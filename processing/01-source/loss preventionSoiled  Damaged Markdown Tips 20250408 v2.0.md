Soiled & Damaged Markdown Tips

Could these items be sold in the markdown area?

No:
- Items missing warning labels or instruction electrical booklets.
- Faulty or used electrical items.
- Items missing parts that make the item unsafe to use if resold e.g., padding in a bike helmet, or a scooter without wheels.
- Items that are broken with sharp edges.
- Items that could pose a hygiene risk if resold.
- Apparel that has been stained or damaged e.g., torn, has chemical/sweat/body fluids.

Yes:
- One of the items is missing from a set.
- Items without packaging or damaged packing that can be repacked.
- Items with superficial damaged such as scratches, dents, chips missing parts e.g., Lego piece, part of kitchen set etc.
- Items that are marked*
- Items that have been assembled (after being assessed by a repair/huffy repair agent).

IMPORTANT: Electrical products are not to be tested or re-sold, as electrical exposure is a critical risk.

IMPORTANT: If a product has items missing but the remaining items are in a saleable condition, these should be sold as a soiled and damaged item. This includes sets of glasses where one may be broken but the remaining glasses are in saleable condition. In this instance you just need to ensure there are no broken fragments of the broken glass in the box.
