Apparel Empty Packets Process

Apparel Empty Packets
The following process needs to be followed to ensure that tags are managed effectively to maintain accurate inventory and quality digital tasks.

Apparel Empty Packets Process

An empty packet is where it is evident that the merchandise has been stolen, for example, when an apparel tag is concealed. How we manage these tags is critical to ensure that we have an accurate inventory count and items a treated in the correct way (i.e. used in backfill tasks).

Make sure you're checking hot spot areas for empty packets, as Tory reads RFID kimble tags not the item itself, these include:

• Change rooms (behind mirrors, under fitting room seating)
• Back of the bike units
• Shed area (home décor)
• Cosmetics area
• Areas were there isn't much customer traffic
• Back of house areas e.g., stock room, tea rooms

Equipment required:

You will need the following items when completing the Apparel Empty Packets process:
• Scissors
• Gloves
• Tagging gun (to reapply kimble tags)

Step 1:
Kimble tags found on floor directly under or around product location quickly try and locate and reattach to product using a tagging gun and gloves

Step 2:
If the RFID kimble tag is found and the item cannot be located for the tag to be reattached.

The RFID kimble tag needs to be cut in half from top to bottom BEFORE the next Tory run so it isn't counted. Please ensure that you wear gloves to complete this process

Step 3:
Once the RFID kimble tag has been cut in half, dispose of the tag in the rubbish bin
