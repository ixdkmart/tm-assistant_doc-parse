FlyBuys

Introduction
FlyBuys is an incentive scheme available to individuals but not companies. FlyBuys rewards customers by issuing points for purchases in Kmart stores, as well as other Coles Group businesses.

FlyBuys cardholders receive a statement every two months showing how many points they have collected. Customers can exchange these points later for free air travel and a range of other products.

How FlyBuys works
Customers can apply for a FlyBuys card at any Kmart store. Customers must complete an application form before being issued with a FlyBuys card.

Customers can present their FlyBuys card at any stage of the transaction up to and including the point where the Customer Service Operator (CSO) presses Total. The customer is then awarded FlyBuys points based on the total purchases made in any one store, on any one day.

For layby purchases, points are not processed until the completion of the layby.

Ineligible transactions
Points are not awarded to FlyBuys cardholders for:
• Gift Card purchases, however, points do apply on redemption of the card
• third-party vendor items, for example purchases from PixiFoto
• items purchased under non-merchandise or sundry codes, for example delivery charges
• laybys started before the customer joined the FlyBuys scheme
• purchases charged to a customer account
• payment for repaired goods
• freight charges where the freight is listed separately
• layby service fees
• purchases made off-site, for example at camping exhibitions
• Coles Group Source MasterCard credit card payments.

Kmart team members cannot use FlyBuys cards in conjunction with:
• company purchases, for example milk for the tea room
• the company Visa card, for example food purchases when travelling for business.
