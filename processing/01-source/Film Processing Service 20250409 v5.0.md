IMPORTANT:

• PLEASE NOTE: ALL orders are to be paid for in store at time of DROP OFF

• DO NOT send customer orders loose in the Mailbag. ALL orders MUST be placed in the white courier bag first & sealed with the log book paper work completed & stuck on the outside in the clear pocket.

• NO NEGATIVES will be returned. NIL. If customer wishes to have negatives returned then do NOT process their order as this is a service NOT offered. All images will be electronically sent to stores.

• No printed orders sent back to stores direct from the supplier or via the Kmart HO mailroom. This eliminates the possibility of lost orders as all orders are printed in store!

HOW THE PROCESS WORKS (as per current process – no change):

1. Photo Centre team members complete the FILM PROCESSING WORKBAG
• Staff to ensure ALL details are completed & the customer is given the top section of the workbag
• PLEASE NOTE: ALL orders are to be paid for in store at time of DROP OFF

2. Order details are then documented on the 35mm FILM ORDER LOG form that is kept at the Photo Centre counter. This form is a 2-part-docket & is provided in your start-up kit.

• STORE copy – this will be kept by the store for proof of what orders were sent for processing. Once all orders have been printed & collected by customers, this form can be filed away for future reference.
• PC copy – this will be kept by Photo Create. Once they receive the courier bag with orders from the store, PC team will check the orders received with the orders listed on the Log form. If these do not match, PC will contact the store to clarify, before printing any of these orders.

It is imperative that stores use this form to keep track of all orders that are taken in store & when orders were sent to PC for processing.

3. Place all completed Film Workbags in the WHITE COURIER BAGS
• White courier bags are for 1 use only, as no orders will be returned to the store.
• Courier bags are provided in your start-up kit & can be re-ordered using the re-order form.

4. Place a CLEAR PLASTIC ADHESIVE POCKET on the back of the white courier bag.
• Adhesive pockets are included with the white courier bags.

5. Place 2 copies of the 35mm FILM ORDER LOG inside this clear plastic pocket. Stores are to keep & file away the 'STORE COPY' of the film order log sheet & place the 'KMART MAIL ROOM COPY' and 'DIGITAL IMAGING NETWORK COPY' in the plastic pocket.

6. Take the WHITE COURIER BAG to the BACK OFFICE. The mailbag will need to be sent direct to Photo Create for processing by booking via the Australia Post Parcel Send website.

7. PC will develop the negatives & transfer the order into a digital file. Please Note: there is no loss of image quality during this process.

8. Film orders will be visible in the store's 'Kodak Apex Order Manager' that processes the day-to-day in-store kiosk orders. This will take 7-10 days from when the order leaves your store.

9. Ensure Film orders are printed on the day they are received in the Order Manager. (Refer to the 'ORDER PRINTING PROCESS' information below)

10. Team members are to tick off completed orders on the 35mm Order Log. File Order Log form away one all orders are printed.

11. Printed orders can then be filed away ready for customer pick-up.

ORDER PRINTING PROCESS:

1. Film orders will automatically download to 'NETWORK ORDERS' tab on the Order Manager screen in the stores 'Kodak APEX Order Manager'

2. Film orders need to be printed the same day they download to your Kodak Apex Order Manager.

3. Kmart Team Members are to release these orders for printing as you would a kiosk or online order.

4. Completed orders should be packed into a Print Wallet and the order label affixed to the package. (The original film Workbag is not returned to the store)

UNCOLLECTED PRINTED ORDERS:

Uncollected photo centre orders must be kept for a minimum of seven (7) months before disposing of these items in the specified secure manner.

• Staff are required to contact the customers twice prior to disposing of the printed order/s.

• If you have printed orders that have not been collected by customers after seven (7) months and after you have contacted the customer twice, they must be disposed of in the following manner to enable us to meet our legal requirement under the Privacy Act:
