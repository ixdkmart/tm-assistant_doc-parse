QRC - Cyclic Gap Scan Process

Introduction

To address merchandise gaps, the gap scan function was introduced to allow shelf edge labels to be scanned and adjust stock on hand immediately when differences in stock counts are identified.

Stock on hand (SOH) integrity is critical for the effective replenishment in stores as well as the stock levels on the Kmart website. It must be maintained frequently for an accurate SOH integrity, particularly out of stock (OOS) lines that result in:

• Effective and efficient system replenishment of items to the store resulting in increased in-stock position
• Increased sales and profits
• Improved customer service experience through better range offer and better customer service
• Simplification of other store processes that rely on SOH integrity

Maintaining stock on hand integrity will also improve processes associated with filling, shop keeping and online picking.

Summary of Process

Gap scans must be completed weekly, with a narrow focus on areas each week and a full store completion across a 4-week period. A 5-week period will have a provision for targeted departments or store/state specific focus areas.

The gap scan areas need to be broken into sequence departments (except for health and beauty) and completed over the 4-week period.

Weekly department location refresh is to be completed every second period, to maximise data and range integrity. This replaces the full store location refresh scheduled for each quarter.

The store task tool is updated to reflect gap scans and location refresh schedules to assist in forward planning.

Gap Scan Schedules

Rolling Gap Scan Schedule
Week | Gapscan Zones | Location Refresh | Inclusions
Week 1 | H1, K1, C1 & Registers | H2, K3 (C2 optional) & D85 | C1 -Power tables
