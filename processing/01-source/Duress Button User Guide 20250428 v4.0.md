The Duress button is located within the register area of the store. Store Leadership teams must ensure that all Team members know the location of the duress button and in which situations it should be used.

IMPORTANT: The Duress Button key must be placed onto a key ring and added to the key cabinet and key register. Do not leave the key in the duress button.
