Welcome

We're excited you're here!

Once you've completed your mandatory "Kmart new store team member (wages) training" modules in Our Learning Hub (LMS), your next step is to attend an in-store induction (store discovery tour). Your store will contact you to organise this induction. You will have the induction prior to commencing any work at the store.

During your store induction, you will go on a tour of the store, and:
• learn about the different areas of your store
• discover important information about working for Kmart
• learn relevant health and safety procedures including what to do in an emergency in your store
• explore the store with a buddy
• review our policies and sign our Kmart Code of Conduct and Policy Acknowledgement form.

Your manager and/or buddy will help you with all of the above.

Once you've completed the store discovery/induction, both you and your manager must log into the LMS and mark completion for the Safety practical and Store Induction/Discovery using the OJT (On the job Training) checklist. Your manager will guide you through this.

Purpose of this guide

This guide is optional reading and provides a summary of what's covered in your store induction. It also provides some key callouts and contact information, so it's a handy resource to keep for future reference.

Union
Unions play a key role at Kmart – they help resolve workplace issues and negotiate on your behalf as we have worked together to establish your conditions of employment. For many years, Kmart has had a good relationship with the unions that represent Kmart team members' interests. Union membership is completely voluntary.

Store image
Our customers find our products and prices irresistible. Now our store upgrades are making the shopping experience exciting, too.

But a store isn't great without great service. And that's where you come in.

By being easily recognisable as team members, you help customers find what they need faster. And that's why we want you looking irresistible too with our uniform options.

Our uniform
We've got a smart look for you with our uniform options:
• Short or long sleeve checked shirt
• Short sleeve polo top
• Polar fleece top/vest for stores in cold weather areas

Full-time? You'll receive five shirts or polo tops. If you're part-time, you'll receive four.
Casual team members will receive two.

Your image
Our smart look comes with smart choices.

You can choose to order free shirts or polo tops, too. If your store is in a cold area, let your manager know if you'd like to order a free polar fleece or vest.

To finish your look, you'll need to add:
• Chino pants or jeans in black, navy or beige
• Skirts or shorts (but not too short!) in black, navy or beige (not denim)
• Fully enclosed, black footwear with non-slip rubber soles, padding and arch support
• Or a lowered or wedged heel suitable for the business environment

Personal Protective Equipment
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is anything used or worn by a team member to minimise risks to their health and safety. PPE helps keep you safe on the job.

## Page 10

At Kmart, this may include cut resistant gloves, safety footwear, high-visibility vests, team safety cameras and eye protection.

Every team member needs a pair of cut resistant gloves to protect their hands. Gloves must be worn when handling broken or sharp products, and when using retractable knife

You'll need safety footwear when using mobile plant equipment including pallet jacks, forklifts, electric pallet jacks and walkie stackers to protect your feet from a potential serious injury. We have a range of styles for every team member. Thick socks will help prevent blisters and discomfort during the first few wears.

Your role and where you work will determine what kind of PPE you will need to wear. Your manager will let you know, and they will show you how to correctly use, wear and maintain your PPE. You must let your manager know as soon as there are any issues with your PPE (e.g., it is no longer fitting properly or has broken).

Creating the customer experience

We know our customers love shopping at Kmart. So to make their experience irresistible, there are some simple customer service tips and strategies you can apply.

Look out for the Kmart Way Customer Service online learning module where you will learn more about these principles in detail.

Profit protection

Kmart loses millions of dollars each year to: theft (internal and external); team members not following correct processes and policies; fraud (e.g refund fraud); cash discrepancies; and damaged merchandise.

These losses are known as 'shrinkage', and these losses cause less merchandise to be available for our customers, with impacts including:

• Less sales (both in store and online) as customers can no longer purchase these missing items
• Impacts to the customer experience, as they may not be able to get exactly what they need (which can also impact their decision to shop with Kmart in the future)
• Less profit as sales of existing merchandise will cover the cost of the lost item rather than contribute to profit.

As a Kmart team member, you can make a big impact to help reduce shrinkage and increase profits in your store by:

• Always follow profit protection policies and procedures
• Always be aware of your surroundings:

Page 12 of 19

## Page 13

o If something isn't right, report it
o If you see empty merchandise packets, report it
• If you're not sure, reach out to your manager
• Review any relevant Profit protection communications to keep up to date
• Follow the 5 D's and never put yourself in harms way!

Customer dishonesty

Customer theft occurs in different ways including:

• Theft of merchandise
• Refund fraud
• Failure to pay for merchandise through the self-service checkouts
• Swapping price tickets on products
• Damaging stock
• Counterfeit notes/coins

These customers like to go unnoticed, or attempt to distract team members, so it's important that team members are always aware of their surroundings, whilst providing great customer service, which is achieved through:

• Saying 'Hello' with a smile to every customer
• Offer your assistance
• Keep all areas of the store clean and tidy
• Walk the high shrink area of your store wherever possible e.g., on your way to back of house areas, on the way to the shop floor etc
• If in a Customer Greeter role, conduct bag checks when a customer leaves the store, checking items against valid receipts
• If something doesn't look right, or you notice suspicious behaviour, alert a manager discreetly.
• Never put yourself in harms way!

Team member dishonesty

At Kmart, we acknowledge that our team members are hardworking and honest. Each team member is recruited because of these qualities. Unfortunately, there have been occasions where some team members do not abide by the same code of conduct. This may see some team members steal from the business, which could present as the following:
• Taking, using, or eating merchandise without paying for it
• Taking cash from a register or cash machine
• Fraudulent refunds
• Theft of merchandise
• Register operators not charging full price or not scanning all merchandise that is presented to them by friends or family.

Page 13 of 19

## Page 14

• Misuse of the Kmart For You discount card and/or Flybuys card due to not understanding the terms and conditions that apply.

To ensure that we uphold our business practices, it is the expectation of all Kmart team members (includes Store, DC and National Office team members), to present their bag/s that are of A4 in size or larger, when exiting a store/DC on all occasions.

Kmart may also, at its discretion, conduct random locker checks. If a random locker check is required, team members will be advised prior to the inspection. Refer to the Kmart Team member Bag Check Process for further information.

If you see something suspicious, alert your Line/Store Manager. Alternatively, you can also call the confidential Kmart Group Speak Up! Hotline (contact information below).
