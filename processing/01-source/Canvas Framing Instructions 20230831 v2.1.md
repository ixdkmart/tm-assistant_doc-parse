Canvas Framing Instructions

1. Your canvas image must be larger than your stretcher bars by 3 inches in width and height. This allows the canvas to wrap around the edges and allow you to still have correctly centered the image. The Kmart printers are already set up for this.

2. Set out all the materials neatly on the bench before you start. Ensure surface area is clean. Remove the adhesive strip cover from all the bars, leaving the white adhesive strip on each bar.

3. Insert the bars into the red corner clamps so that the adhesive strip is facing up and towards the outside edge. There is a slot on the stretcher bar that must align with a 3cm cut tab on the corner clamp to ensure proper positioning. If they are not aligned, the stretcher bar will not go into the clamp.

4. Center the stretcher assembly over the flat canvas as per the picture. Make sure that the stretcher bars land inside the material and that there is a little left for trimming.

5. Start by pushing the bars that are opposite to each other down so that the adhesive makes contact with your canvas. Then repeat for the other sides.

6. Remove the corner red jigs by pulling up while holding the wooden bars down. Trim off excess canvas material by running blade firmly, and not too quickly, along each wooden bar. Require neat / clean finish. Make sure to angle the cutter handle to 45 degrees as you cut. Gloves to be worn when using the cutter/blade.

Cut the corner from where the stretchers meet outwards at 45°. Be careful not to cut inside where the stretcher bars meet.

7. Fold the corners firmly onto the adhesive ends.

8. IMPORTANT!!
Run a small bead of IG wrap glue along the inside of the stretcher bars. Not too much glue but a nice bead.

9. Bring the bars up to close the frame and insert staple firmly using red corner clamps to push staples into wooden bars – be firm so staples sit flat into the wooden bars.

10. Insert the corner braces into the groove on the inside of the stretcher frame. Gently push the braces towards the corners to increase tension. Repeat all 4 corners.
