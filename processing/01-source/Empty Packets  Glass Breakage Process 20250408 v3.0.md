Empty Packets & Glass Breakage Process

Empty packets are the packaging taken off products sold within Kmart, which are usually hidden or concealed within the store, in both obvious and hidden areas. Identifying empty packets is an indication of theft in a store, and it's important that all store teams are aware of hot spot areas for empty packets, and what to do if they find them. Some high-volume areas for empty packets include:

• Change rooms (behind mirrors, under fitting room seating)
• Back of the bike units
• Shed area (home décor)
• Cosmetics area
• Areas were there isn't much customer traffic
• Back of house areas e.g., stock room, tea rooms

Each store is different and will have different keycodes that are identified regularly as an empty packet. It's important to know what the top empty packet keycodes are in your store, so you can be aware and create a stronger presence in the areas the keycodes are located. This information is obtained by referring to the number of empty packet adjustments under code 21.

Tips to Reduce Empty Packets
• Keep your team informed regularly on the results of empty packets located in your store.
• Create a red route and encourage the team to walk these areas during shifts, when leaving the store for a break, or leaving the store at the end of a shift.
• Know your empty packet hotspot areas and encourage the team to frequent these areas.
• If empty packets or anything suspicious is observed report it immediately to a manager.
• Know your stores Persons of Interest (POI), reach out to your Profit Protection Business Partner for assistance.

Empty Packet Bin Setup
It's important that your empty packet bins are set up in the back of house area, so Team Members can place all identified empty packets into them so they can be accounted for and written off using adjustment code 21. Here are some great setup examples to follow:

[Images show three different setups of empty packet collection bins with labels for different departments like "Kids World Empty Packets," "Clothing World Empty Packets," and "Home World Empty Packets"]
