The New 4Ds for Threatening Situations & Lockdowns (Stores)
Take Care Talk
Kmart and Target Health & Safety

To be delivered by:
A manager

What is this team talk about:
Managing Threatening Situations (The 4Ds) and initiating a lockdown.

Audience:
All team members.

Key messages to be delivered by management team during huddles/team meetings:

- Unfortunately, threatening situations remain common within the retail and supply chain sector. Threatening situations occur when our team are faced with acts of violence, aggression and other crimes. These events have the potential to cause serious physical or psychological injury.

- Following feedback from team members and a review of best practice guidance for managing violence and aggression in the workplace, we have updated our framework for managing threatening situations.

- We've updated our managing threatening situations framework, now known as the 4Ds (previously the 5Ds at Kmart and 3D's at Target). The 4D's are:

Distance: Maintain a safe distance from any potentially threatening person or situation to protect yourself. Never follow a threatening person outside the store or try to grab their bag or trolley.

De-escalate: Remain polite and use a clear, calm voice to prevent the situation becoming worse.

Disengage: If you sense the person or situation escalating or if you feel unsafe, remove yourself from the area and notify a manager

And after an event,

Debrief: After an event, conduct a wellbeing check for everyone involved and discuss any lessons learned as a team.

- It's important that all team members and managers are aware of the new 4D's, and everyone is crystal clear on expectations of what teams should and shouldn't do in these situations.

Pause and ask the team if they have any questions.

- Locking down the store is one of the controls we have to keep everyone safe during serious event, such as an armed person in the mall or carpark, or a fight / riot breaks out outside the store.

- Over the next few weeks, a lockbox will be installed at the front of store for the entry roller door keys. This will allow for quick access should we need to lockdown.

When should a lockdown be initiated?
- Any team member or manager can initiate a lockdown. For example, if a customer greeter sees an armed person outside the store, they can initiate a lockdown immediately using the push to talk to communicate "code lockdown" and describe what is happening and where so managers can act quickly and lockdown the store.

When should the lockbox be accessed?
- If a manager is not immediately available at the front of the store, they may provide the lockbox code to a team member and instruct them to access the lockbox located at the front. This allows the team member to initiate the lockdown response quickly by closing the roller gates or doors.

Why the Change:
- Based on feedback from our recent lockdown simulation exercise, it was noted that the time required for a manager to get to the front of the store or access the roller door keys can delay the response time during critical emergencies. A lockbox at the front of the store will help reduce the time it takes to initiate a lockdown.

Pause and ask the team if they have any questions.

What if the armed or violent person is inside our store? Do we still lockdown?
- Lockdown drills are designed to protect people from violent or dangerous activity occurring outside the site. Here's what to do if a dangerous individual is inside the site:
• Your safety and the safety of others is the priority. Evacuate the store if possible and safe to do so.
• Do not engage with the dangerous person. This could escalate the situation.
• Call the police immediately. Provide details about the situation, including the person's location and description (clothing, weapon).
• If you can safely use a duress alarm, do so. This will discreetly alert authorities without provoking the dangerous person.
• If you can't evacuate, find a secure location within the store, away from the individual. This could be the designated Safe Zone, back office, storage room, or fitting room.
• Lock the door and barricade it with furniture if possible.
• Silence your phone to avoid detection.
• Breathe, stay calm and quiet. Await further instructions from emergency services.

Wrap up:
- Recap the 4D's and Lockdown/Lockbox process
- Encourage team members to report all threatening situation type incidents, regardless of how big or small
- Remind the team that no product is worth their life, and to practice the 4D's to keep them and everyone else safe.
- Thank the team
