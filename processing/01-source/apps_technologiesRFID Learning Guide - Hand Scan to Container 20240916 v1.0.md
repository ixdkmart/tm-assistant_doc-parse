Switching hand wand between far mode/near mode

When scanning BOH areas, there is an option to switch between modes. By selecting the 'far mode' option it will allow the wand to capture more tags from a distance as the strength is maximised.

It is recommended, that when scanning areas close to online containers or zones 1, 2 and 3, to switch back to 'near mode' to avoid tags being picked up from a distance and captured incorrectly.

Each time data is booked in the mode it will switch back to the original setting.

To the left is a video showing how to switch between modes.
