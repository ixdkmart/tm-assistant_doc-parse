Introduction

Who should use this Guide?

This Guide is intended for use by all Kmart and Target Store and Distribution Centre (DC) team members. It provides guidance to team members on how to best manage circumstances where there is a either an identified or suspected foreign insect or species found within a product or products that we sell. This is inclusive of containers that have travelled from overseas. It also outlines the regulatory requirements for addressing such cases.

Background – What is the risk to the business and environment?

Introduced and invasive foreign insects (inclusive of borers) and other species have the potential to affect our agriculture export industries, as well as our unique environment, native flora and fauna and our tourism industries, amongst other serious ramifications.

When a section of either business, be it a DC, a store, or National Office (N.O.), becomes aware of a potential foreign insect infestation or species contamination, of a product or series of products (or in a shipping container), we are obliged to manage the issue in a specific way. This is to ensure that not only do we protect our environment, we are also meeting legislative requirements that are governed by either the Department of Water and Environment (DAWE) for Australia, or Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) for New Zealand. If not, penalties may apply to our business, which in turn can cause reputational damage.

The foreign contamination could appear as a live or dead insect or a larger species, such as a reptile or rodent etc. Alternatively, there could be evidence of its presence, such as the below images, which is an example of borer activity within a wooden product. It could be as subtle as the first two images, or as prominent as the second two images.

[Table with 4 images showing:]
Evidence of tracks | Extreme activity (and Frass)
Image of borer holes to scale | Borer activity will reveal grains of wood (Frass)
Note: filler will appear as grey/white dust. This image is evidence of frass or wood grains being pushed out of the product.

Actions

When a store or DC either identify a potential foreign insect or species contamination, either themselves or it is flagged by a third party (be it a customer, a regulator, the media, etc.), the following steps must be followed.

Team member identification (store or DC):

If a team member notices either a potential foreign insect or species (dead or alive), or evidence of the presence of such within a product or the packaging, the following must occur:

- remove all the noted affected product/s from the immediate area. Do not dispose of the product.
- Take images of the evidence and document the affected keycodes and batch code/s;
- double plastic bag the product/s or use shrink wrap to secure the evidence within (make airtight). To note, if the contaminant is of concern to the safety of the individual handling the product/s, a precautionary measure of wearing gloves and a mask, should be taken.
- Isolate the product/s, away from other products, at a minimum by 1.5m from other wooden products (where feasible), to prevent cross contamination (particularly in the cases of borer), out the back of store.
- label the wrapped product/s "contaminated" or "borer" or similar. Add the number of products within and batch code/s (use the labels at the end of the document).
- inspect all the other product of the same keycode to see if there is any evidence of infestation, and even if there is no presence of contamination, remove from the shop floor.
- document a count of each batch code then double plastic bag the product/s or use shrink wrap to secure the evidence within (make airtight). Keep these separate from the initial contaminated product.
- To note: if the foreign species is located outside of a product, it is important to contain the suspect, however it is also important to not place yourself or anyone else in harm's way. If the foreign species is alive and potentially harmful, place a solid container over it to contain it. If it can be captured without concern of harm, do so. Otherwise undertake this in the best way without risk to self.
- Contact National Office via an email to regulatory.affairs@kmart.com.au and the Customer Service Centre via CustomerServiceCentreKmart@kmart.com.au
- Await further instructions from National Office.

Customer's sample returned to a store:

If a customer returns a product to store with a suspected live or dead insect or foreign species, or there is evidence of the presence of a suspected foreign species:

- If the customer contacts the store to inform of the contamination, request they take images of the foreign species or the evidence of their presence. Request the customer to double plastic bag the product/s or use cling wrap to secure the evidence within (make airtight).
- If the customer returns the product without notification and no bag, immediately double bag the product and label 'contaminated' or 'borer' or similar, and isolate, away from other products, at a minimum by 1.5m from other wooden products (where feasible), to prevent cross contamination (particularly in the cases of borer), out the back of store.
- Process the customer's return as per usual.
- Contact National Office via an email to regulatory.affairs@kmart.com.au and the Customer Service Centre via CustomerServiceCentreKmart@kmart.com.au
- Await further instructions from National Office.

- Await further instructions from National Office.

- Do not dispose of the product as it may be required to be picked up by The Regulator for an investigation.

Regulator contact:
Occasionally a Regulator, whether it be the state-based Regulator (biosecurity) or a representative from DAWE, or if in New Zealand, MPI, may contact one of our locations. It is important to follow the Regulator Contact Guidelines for Store, National Office & DCs.

Media contact:
Another avenue for potential reporting of such instances can come through media attention or enquiries. It is important to try to obtain the customer details, if possible, so that the customer service team can follow up directly with the customer, to determine all the information available and make arrangements to obtain the sample. If the enquiry has come through an avenue other than Corporate Affairs, then the team at national office will need to be notified at KmartCorporateAffairs@kmart.com.au, along with the compliance team at regulatory.affairs@kmart.com.au
