Purpose of this guide

Customer service tools help us provide efficient and timely service to our customers.

We want to make sure team members have a chance to get familiar with these tools before using them on the job.

This guide provides an opportunity for team members to practise some of the key tools with their line manager or buddy. It also provides tips along the way on how to use the tools effectively.

How to complete this activity

Manager or buddy:

• Provide team members with the following tools:
   o Utility belt
   o Push to Talk (P2T) unit and earpiece
      ■ Team members should clean P2Ts before using it using alcohol wipes.
   o Portable Data Terminal (PDT)
   o Telephone – cordless handset
   o Blank copy of the Customer Service Form

• Help your team members learn these tools by guiding them with the recommended steps given below for each tool.

• Make sure you also have access to your own set of these tools to assist team members.

• Encourage questions and make sure team members are comfortable using the tools.

Let's have a go!

Utility belt

The utility belt is a useful tool designed specifically for shop floor and stockroom team members. It allows you to carry tools and supplies needed to perform customer service functions and store presentation effectively.

- Internal phone numbers, white gloves & customer service booklet
- Clear tape and dispenser 
- PDT
- Pen and marker
- Alcohol wipes & plastic hook holder replacements

Have a go!

1. Grab a utility belt and note the contents within.
   Tip: Before you need to use them on your shift, check if your belt contains all the items that you need to perform your function.

Push to Talk (P2T)

The P2T is a small radio device with a wired earpiece that rests on your ears. You use it to talk to your colleagues to ask for help or communicate information. If you are required to use a P2T, before starting your shift, get a unit and check that it works first.

Have a go!

1. Grab your P2T and compare the diagram above with the real device you have in front of you to understand the model. Check the equipment is in good condition, with no broken parts or exposed wires. Report to a manager if faulty or broken.

2. Turn the P2T on/off.
Tip: Always return the P2T unit to the charging cradle at the end of your shift with the cord neatly wound up. When taking meal breaks, it's important to remove the earpiece or turn it off so you can 'switch off'.

3. Connect earpiece securely by screwing in, so it is tight.
Ensure you use alcohol wipes to clean the earpiece before and after using it. Before using the wipes, consider if you are allergic to their ingredients.

4. Check the earpiece is working. Adjust the volume using the controls so that you are able to hear clearly but not overly loud.
Tip: Take particular care around moving equipment as there is potential for the cord to get caught, tearing the earpiece from your ear and/or tearing the cord from the P2T unit. Thread the P2T earpiece cord down your top if possible.

5. Talk and listen.
• Buddy to have a P2T on to help team members practice talking and listening on the P2T. Say your name to let them know who they are listening to.

Tips:
• When completing high risk tasks that require focus, such as operating forklifts, walkie stackers, or using the cardboard baler, it is recommended to remove, or mute the earpiece to avoid distraction and maintain concentration.
• Listen out for any queries in the area you are working in, or if anyone in the store needs your help.

PDT

The PDT is a device to scan merchandise to check price, check stockroom location and stock status/availability at your store or other stores. You can also use PDT to complete your online training and access other online resources such as the intranet, etc.

[Image shows a Zebra handheld device with labeled components:]

- Touch screen display
- Store App to access stock info
- Scan trigger
- Online picking and packing app

Have a go!

1. Log in and navigate the menu on the PDT.
   • For your first login, your username is your employee number, and password is your date of birth DDMMYYYY.
   • Tip: Check the PDT before you start, that your log in is working. If not, ask a manager to reset your password.
   • When using a PDT for long periods, swap hands to avoid wrist injuries and try alternating between the side and trigger scanner options. When scanning for long periods, attach a trigger handle.

2. Assist with an Item/Stock On Hand (SOH) enquiry.
   Tip: If you need to confirm the price of an item to a customer during your shift, do advise them of our price scanning stations located across the store.

3. Perform an item search. Item searches are used to look up the details of a specific item when you don't have a barcode or keycode available.

4. Search by style and log out.

Telephone

The telephone helps us establish a positive impression of Kmart with our customers. These phones use internal lines. We use our internal phone system to answer enquiries from customers, place calls on hold and transfer calls.

There are two main internal phones used in our stores - a cordless handset or a desktop phone. In some stores, a PDT is also used as a phone.

In this activity, you will use a cordless handset.

- Key lock, upper/lower case
- Navigation keys

Then practise putting their call on hold, and taking it off hold.

5. Transfer a call.

Tip: Find out where your store keeps items that are 'on-hold' and items that are being transferred. This may vary from store to store.
