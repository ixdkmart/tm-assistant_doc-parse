Customer Account Processing

Step | Action

Step 1
- Customer accounts are processed at the service counter.
- Before processing the transaction ensure the customer has the right documentation to continue.
- The customer should provide a purchase order on business letterhead with the account number listed, the amount they are spending and a description of the approved items for purchase.
- The purchase order must be kept by the store.

Step 2
Sign on to the register and select Layby or Account transactions>Customer Account

Step 3
Enter the customer account number.

Step 4
- Scan the approved items and press total. No payment will be needed to finalise the transaction.
- Two receipts will print, one for the customer and one to keep.
- The receipt to be kept will require the customers signature confirming they made the purchase.
- Attach the store copy to the purchase order. This will need to be kept in the applicable customer account file.
- Wrap the items in a black layby bag and tape the customer receipt to the bag being careful not to place tape over any of the print.

Note:
If the account will not allow you to process the transaction it may be due to suspension for non-payment. In this instance you cannot proceed until payment has been made and the account reactivated.

If the account allows you to start processing, then voids the transaction mid scanning it means that the account limit has been exceeded. If this occurs you will need to review the account to see how much credit is available.

Purchase Order Example

Purchase Orders should include the following:
• Company Letterhead
• Date (not older than a week)
• Purchase Order number (this should not be a generic/duplicated number)
• Customer Account Number to be charged
• Authorised purchaser
• Maximum allowed spend
• Items authorised for purchase
• Company contact details

Validate the authorised customer ID
• Ensure the name matches the customer ID (do not record any details)

Action:
Ensure the above items are checked before processing the customer account charge.
You will need to also ensure that the authorised customer name matches the government ID of the customer who has presented the purchase order. Do not record any details from the identification, only validate the name on the ID matches the name on the purchase order.

Note:
There have been instances of fraudulent purchase orders being presented to stores. If you are at all unsure if the purchase order is valid contact the company using the contact details on file. Do not call the number provided on the purchase order.

Customer Account Payment

Step | Action

Overview:
Customer account payments are made via EFT to a Head Office Account. When a payment is made you will receive an email from Accounts Receivable with a store memo attached. The store memo details the payment amount received for a particular charge number. You may receive multiple payments on the one store memo. Payments need to be processed at the service counter or allocated register.

Step 2: Sign on to the register and select Layby or Account transactions

Step 3: Enter charge number, select make a payment

Step 4: Enter payment amount as listed on store memo, select ok

Step 5: Select 'Other Tenders' tab

Step 6: Enter tender amount, this is the same as the payment amount, select ok and complete payment as normal

Step 7: Attach the payment receipt to the memo and take to the back office for processing

Note:
The completed payment will cause a cash register error until it is processed through the cash management system. Payments can only be completed on a register that is activated through the Cash Management System. You should only use a register for payments that is currently being used for sales.

Customer Account Guide

Customer Account Cash Management System (CMS) Process

Step 1
- Log into CMS.
- Select the Inputs tab.
- Account payments are entered into the purple HO Customer Account Payments field.
- The date automatically defaults to the previous day.

Step 2
- From the drop-down menu select the register the account payment was completed on.
- Enter the payment amount and select submit.
- If multiple account payments were made on the same register, the full total can be entered.

Step 3
- Once the payment is submitted it will appear on the Total Store Summary report against HO CA Payments.

Step 4
- When you complete the Weekly Cash Report you must enter the HO CA Payment amount against line 61. This enables head office to see the payment was made and apply a credit to the store.

Note:
- If you notice the cash management allocation has caused a cash on hand error, reverse the action, and complete the cash management action on Sunday (Monday morning for Sunday)
- This will balance the register and customer accounts for the same week.
- This is because the payment has been made on a register not used for sales for the week, and the register is not currently listed on the spot balance so has impacted the cash on hand.

Customer Account Troubleshooting

Issue:
If a payment is processed for the wrong amount or even to the incorrect charge it can be reversed. Payment issues and follow up are also listed below in troubleshooting scenarios.

Completed wrong payment on charge:
- You can void the last payment made on the checkout by going to layby and accounts and void payment and entering the full amount (last payment amount)
- You can then complete the payment to the correct charge number.

Charged to wrong account:
If you have charged the wrong account for items, you can refund the items in full as cash for the incorrect account used/charge. You can then make a full payment against that account/charge to finalise and complete. You now can reprocess the charged to the correct account number and send updated payment details to the account holder.

Account holder is not paying charged:
Email Accounts Receivable Kmart ar@kmart.com.au with all details to assist with following up the outstanding charges with all details and evidence of follow up.

Customer paid incorrect amount or have made a duplicate payment:
Email Accounts Receivable Kmart ar@kmart.com.au with all details and they will be able to work through a payment correction.

Customer did not approve charge, or stores does not have evidence of purchase order and customer is disputing payment:
Email Accounts Receivable Kmart ar@kmart.com.au who will need to seek approval to have the amount written off. If this could relate to fraud a profit protection incident should be raised and reported to your business partner.

I have created a new account but it's not appearing:
It can take 24 hours for you to be able to search a new account in CC/POS. Ensure when you add an account you record the account number, as it will take 1 working day to search the details.
