Policy – Family and Domestic Violence Leave

INTRODUCTION
AND PURPOSE
Kmart and Target (together referred to as "the Company") acknowledges that family and domestic violence may directly impact Team Members or their family, including severe health and economic impacts.

The Company is committed to assisting its Team Members experiencing family or domestic violence to seek professional assistance and to provide support to maintain their ongoing employment. The Company commits to providing a workplace that supports the safety and wellbeing of Team Members who are victims of family or domestic violence, either directly or indirectly.

The purpose of this Family and Domestic Violence Leave Policy (Policy) is to provide that support to Team Members experiencing family or domestic violence by providing leave or other support in the workplace.

POLICY APPLICATION
This Policy applies to all employees of the Company (Team Members).

Where a Team Member's employment is covered by the terms of an industrial instrument, such as an enterprise agreement or a modern award, the terms of this Policy will apply to the extent of any inconsistency. However, if this Policy contains a more beneficial term, this Policy will apply to the extent of any inconsistency.

This Policy should be used in conjunction with any other relevant policies or procedures.

This Policy can be varied or withdrawn at any time and does not form part of, and is not incorporated into, a Team Member's contract of employment.

COUNTRY APPLICATION
Australia

DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of this Policy:

Family and domestic violence (FDV) means violent, threatening or other abusive behaviour by a close relative of a Team Member, a member of a Team Member's household, or a current or former intimate partner of a Team Member, that seeks to coerce or control the Team Member and that causes them harm or fear.

Close relative means:
• a spouse (including former spouse), de facto partner (including former de facto partner), child, parent, grandparent, grandchild or sibling of the Team Member;
• a child, parent, grandparent, grandchild or sibling of a spouse (including former spouse) or de facto partner (including former de facto partner) of

• the Team Member;
• a person who is related to the Team Member according to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander kinship rules.

Work Anniversary means the date on which the Team Member's employment started.

POLICY                                    Entitlement

Any Team Member (including a casual Team Member) who is experiencing FDV may access up to 10 days paid FDV leave in a 12-month period, in line with the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth).

FDV leave:

• is available in full (i.e. the 10 days does not accrue progressively over the course of a 12 month period) when the Team Member commences employment, and the entitlement is renewed on the Team Member's work anniversary each year;

• may be taken as a single continuous 10-day period or as separate periods of one or more days each or any separate periods to which the Company and a Team Member agree, including periods of less than one day; and

• does not accumulate from year to year.

For full-time and part-time Team Members, FDV leave will be paid at the Team Member's full rate of pay for the hours that they would have worked if they had not taken leave. Casual Team Members will be paid for hours on which they have been rostered (i.e. the Team Member has accepted an offer to work those hours). Casual Team Members are not prevented from taking a period of FDV leave that does not include rostered hours, however, the Team Member will not be paid for that period.

Paid FDV leave may be taken where the Team Member is experiencing FDV and for the purposes of allowing the Team Member to do something to deal with the impact of the FDV, where it is impractical for the Team Member to perform that activity outside their ordinary hours of work.

Examples of circumstances in which FDV leave may be used include:

• relocating or arranging for their own safety or the safety of a close relative (e.g., finding or moving into safe accommodation, changing locks, installing alarms/video cameras);
• attending court hearings;
• accessing police services; or
• seeking medical, counselling, financial or legal assistance relating to FDV.

In addition to (or instead of) taking paid FDV leave, a Team Member may be able to access other paid leave, such as paid annual leave, long service leave (as per the relevant Long Service Leave legislation) or paid personal/carer's leave.

NOTICE AND EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS
A Team Member must notify the Company of the taking of FDV leave as soon as practicable (which may be at a time after the leave has started) and advise of the period, or the expected period, of the leave.

The Company may request reasonable supporting documentation that the leave taken relates to the purpose above. Without limiting what may constitute reasonable supporting documentation, it may include a document issued by a medical practitioner, a police service, a court or family violence support service or a statutory declaration.

PROCESSING FAMILY AND 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LEAVE
When submitting FDV leave into Dimensions or SuccessFactors, the following pay code should be used:

• For paid FDV leave, 'Special Leave'; and
• For unpaid FDV leave, 'Special Leave unpaid'.

The 'Special Leave unpaid' leave type would be used where the paid entitlement has been exhausted.

CONFIDENTIALITY
The Company will treat information related to a request for support under this Policy as private and confidential to the full extent possible in the circumstances. Matters involving FDV are personal and sensitive, and we understand Team Members would not want other Team Members to know of their circumstances unless they choose to disclose it. However, the Company may need to disclose information if required by law or it is necessary to protect the life, health or safety of a Team Member or another person.

Any disclosure under this Policy, or information revealed about the existence of FDV, will be restricted to a 'needs to know' basis and only to the level of detail necessary. For example, IT, security, or People & Capability may need sufficient information to assess a Team Member's security and safety needs and to take appropriate actions.

A Team Member will be consulted about any disclosure that seems necessary in the circumstances or the development of any workplace safety and security measures.

All Team Members and line managers are responsible to ensure the confidentiality of any disclosure made to them and that the information obtained is used only for the purpose it was provided.

REQUESTS FOR FLEXIBLE
WORKING ARRANGEMENTS
A Team Member may be able to request a change in working arrangements in accordance with the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the Requesting Flexible Working Arrangements Policy. Such requests can be made during working hours.

WORKPLACE SAFETY AND SECURITY

FDV can be perpetrated against a Team Member or may directly impact a Team Member or Team Members, in the workplace. For example:

• the Team Member being phoned, e-mailed or sent text messages on a constant basis;

• attempts to do some harm to the employer/Team Member relationship, including attempts to have a Team Member's employment terminated;

• a perpetrator lurking around the workplace at break times or harassing or intimidating the Team Member whilst they are at work;

• the Team Member being followed to or from work.

This behaviour may also breach court orders, be criminal in nature, or impact the Company's obligation to provide a safe workplace.

Therefore, the Company may need to conduct a review of the workplace safety and security needs of the Team Member as well as take any reasonable safety and security measures upon becoming aware of the potential of FDV occurring in the workplace.

A key safety and security measure is for a Team Member to give permission for the relevant People and Capability representative or, otherwise, another suitable person, to have a copy of any intervention or restraining orders (e.g. PSIO, FVIO, AVO). This will enable the Company to promptly report any breaches of an order to police and obtain police assistance if required.

In consultation with the Team Member and if requested by the Team Member, the relevant People and Capability Business Partner/Manager can also assist with the development of a care plan to apply for the duration that a Team Member is experiencing issues at work associated with FDV.
