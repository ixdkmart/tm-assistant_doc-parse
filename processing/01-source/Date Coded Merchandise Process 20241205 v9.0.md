Managing Date Coded Merchandise

Date Coded Merchandise are products that have either a best before or use by date that advises how long the product will be at its best flavour and/or quality. The differences between best before, used by and expiry dates are:

Used By | The date indicates when the product may no longer be safe to consume/use.

Best Before | The date indicates when the quality of the product is at its best. The product can be consumed/used after this date; however, the quality will not be at its best.

Expiry Date | The date indicates when the product may no longer be safe to consume/use.

It is the responsibility of Kmart Team Members who work in each department with date coded merchandise, to follow the dated goods process every day. This prevents date coded merchandise from being sold out-of-date, infestations and lost profits.

Managers should also ensure that the allocated weekly date coded merchandise checks are completed via Auditor to confirm checks are completed:

• Date Coded Check – Week 1 (Checkouts, Cosmetics, Personal care & Beauty).
• Date Coded Check – Week 2 (Share packs, Boxed Chocolates, Baby & Toys).
• Date Coded Check – Week 3 (Candy Stations, Confectionary, Chips, Auto, Sporting & Camping).
• Date Coded Check – Week 4 (Soda Stream, Pets, Home Maintenance, SIM Cards & Stockroom.

Step 4 | If a date coded product is overstocked ensure overstocks with a longer life span are placed at the rear of the shelf and keep excess stock in the stockroom in a cool location.
