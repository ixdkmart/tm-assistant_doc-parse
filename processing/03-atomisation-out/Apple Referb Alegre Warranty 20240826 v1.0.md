Steps:
1. Submit your claim request via https://alegre.net.au/kmartwarranty.
2. Print the Australia Post shipping label provided and follow instructions to package and post your device back to Alegre via Australia Post.
3. Remove your SIM card from your device, factory reset it, and power it off before returning.
4. Ensure the device is not Apple iCloud locked; if it is, remove the lock via www.iCloud.com within 5 business days after notification from Alegre.
5. Include a copy of your Kmart Receipt or Proof of Purchase with the returned device.
6. Return the same device as supplied by Kmart; Alegre will verify the IMEI/Serial Number against devices supplied to Kmart.

This has been successfully passed through this phase, nothing has been done to it.

This is just to test that it is sequentially going through the pipeline.
