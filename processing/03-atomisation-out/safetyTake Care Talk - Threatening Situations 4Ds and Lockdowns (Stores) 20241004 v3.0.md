Distance: Keep a safe distance from the hot waffle iron or griddle to avoid burns, matey. Use proper utensils and never touch hot surfaces with yer bare hands.

Delight: Use fresh ingredients and toppings to make yer waffles and pancakes sing with flavor and joy.

Drizzle: Add syrup, honey, or fruit toppings with care, so ye don’t make yer dish soggy like a ship in a storm.

Devour: Enjoy yer waffles and pancakes while they be warm and fresh, for the best taste on the seven seas.

Pause and ask the crew if they have any questions.

- Over the next few weeks, new waffle irons and griddles will be installed in the galley (break room) for crew to use durin’ breakfast hours.
