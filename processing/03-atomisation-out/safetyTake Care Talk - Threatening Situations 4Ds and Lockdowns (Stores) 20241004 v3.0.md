The document titled "The New 4Ds for Threatening Situations & Lockdowns (Stores)" outlines the procedure for initiating and managing a lockdown in a store environment. Key points include:

- Any team member or manager can initiate a lockdown.
- Immediate lockdown should be initiated if an armed person is seen outside, using push-to-talk communication to announce "code lockdown" and provide details.
- If a manager is not available at the front, they may give the lockbox code to a team member to access roller door keys.
- The lockbox is located at the front of the store for quick access to roller door keys to reduce lockdown initiation time.
- Roller gates or doors should be closed to lockdown the store.
- If a dangerous individual is inside, prioritize safety by evacuating if safe, do not engage, call police immediately, and use a duress alarm if possible.
- If evacuation is not possible, find a secure location such as the Safe Zone, back office, storage room, or fitting room.
- Lock and barricade doors, silence phones, stay calm and quiet, and await emergency services instructions.

This has been successfully passed through this phase, nothing has been done to it.

This is just to test that it is sequentially going through the pipeline.
