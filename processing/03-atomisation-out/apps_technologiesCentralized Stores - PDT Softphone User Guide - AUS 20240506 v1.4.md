Making a Phone Call Using the PDT Softphone

Steps:
1. Open the PDT softphone app on your device.
2. Note that the dialing plan has changed from 3 digits to 7 digits.
3. To call an internal extension (EXT), prefix the store number in front of the EXT number you wish to call.
4. For example, to call the Store manager's EXT 651 in store 1106, dial 1106651.
5. This prefixing must be done for every EXT within the store, including PA EXT 155.
6. To identify which EXT number you are currently using, select the default user icon on the top right of the screen.
7. On this page, you can see your current EXT number and have the ability to sign out.

Example:
Using 1106 Cranbourne store number, to dial Store manager's EXT 651, dial 1106651.

This has been successfully passed through this phase, nothing has been done to it.

This is just to test that it is sequentially going through the pipeline.
