      "description": "In Australian Federal Law, breastfeeding is a right, not a privilege. Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 it is illegal in Australia to discriminate against a person either directly or indirectly on the grounds of breastfeeding. This means, a woman has the right to breastfeed, or express milk, anywhere she chooses. This includes our stores. Kmart is fully supportive of caregivers and are committed to gender equity - both customers and team members - and this includes their right to breastfeed. No one should ever be asked by a team member to cover themselves or stop breastfeeding or expressing anywhere in our stores. This includes in fitting rooms or on the shop floor.",
