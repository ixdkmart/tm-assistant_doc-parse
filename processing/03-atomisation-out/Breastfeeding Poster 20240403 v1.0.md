      "description": "In Australian Federal Law, breastfeeding is a right, not a privilege. Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 it is illegal in Australia to discriminate against a person either directly or indirectly on the grounds of breastfeeding. This means, a woman has the right to breastfeed, or express milk, anywhere she chooses. This includes our stores.",
