    "Wear safety footwear and gloves when working in decant, online and when moving a H-Cage / HPCs (K hubs) with heavy active weights.",
    "Take mini breaks and rotate tasks to avoid repetitive handling/filling of weights.",
    "Where possible, use four-sided (or wraparound) H-Cages to move weights to prevent them from falling/rolling out.",
    "Place weights in a tote on the lower shelf of a H-Cage to prevent them from falling/rolling out. Do not overload totes – the safe working load is 16 kgs.",
    "Ensure the H-Cage is not overloaded with weights or difficult to move. Remove stock if you need to.",
    "Follow the planograms to merchandise and refresh fitness weights – do not double stack dumbbell Shelf Ready Packaging (SRPs) or hex dumbbells, turn hex dumbbells longways onto shelf to prevent rolling and keep to shelf capacity limits. Ensure the locking mechanism is in place for the weight plate stands."
