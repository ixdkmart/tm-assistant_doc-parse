# FlexiPOS - AirPay Tap

The TC52 PDTs (these PDTs commence with a 200..PDT number) have been updated with Airpay Tap. This allows all FlexiPOS transactions to be processed by tapping the EFT card directly on the back of the PDT when selecting 'Pay @ Card Reader' to complete the transaction.

Note:
The AP3 pinpads or TC51s will no longer be used for FlexiPOS transactions.

When using FlexiPOS for the first time after the upgrade to Airpay Tap, an initial process will need to be performed to verify permissions required to perform Airpay tap transactions.

There is no transaction limit on FlexiPOS Airpay Tap transactions.

The 'Tap and Go limit' (depending on the customer's bank) is $100.00. For transactions over this amount, a new 'Enter Pin' screen will be displayed allowing the customer to enter their pin to complete the transaction.

An AP3 (pinpad) is not required when performing an AirPay tap transaction.

AirPay Tap can only be used on a TC52 PDT. These PDTs commence with 20, e.g., KMPD201323.
