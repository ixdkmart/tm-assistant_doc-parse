## How does a customer use their Afterpay Card to purchase in-store?
The customer can initiate the transaction via the Afterpay app or launch the card directly from their digital wallet. The customer taps their Afterpay Card on your card terminal to pay and finalize the transaction.

## How do I process an Afterpay Card sale in-store?
Process the Afterpay Card purchase the same way as any other contactless card transaction such as Eftpos, Visa or MasterCard. The customer can initiate the purchase via their Afterpay app or directly via their digital wallet. To finalize the transaction, they tap their Afterpay Card on your card terminal. The transaction is then complete.

## Is there a minimum spend with Afterpay Card?
Some stores may choose to add a minimum spend with Afterpay. At Kmart, there is no minimum spend with Afterpay in-store.

2. They click on 'How it works' above their pre-approved available to spend limit.
3. They scroll down to 'How do I return an order?' and tap the 'Refund to Afterpay Card' button.

Note: If the original sale was made using Afterpay, the refund must go back onto the customer's Afterpay Card and no other tender type.

# Can I do a split tender sale with Afterpay Card?
Yes, if your business allows split tender transactions. Enter the amount the customer wishes to spend on their Afterpay Card as a normal card payment. The customer taps their Afterpay Card on your card terminal. Then process the remaining balance with another tender type such as cash or another card.

# What is the maximum amount a customer can purchase using their Afterpay Card?
This varies for each customer. Customers typically have between $600 and $3000 available to spend. The available to spend amount can be viewed on the card tab in the Afterpay app.

# What happens if a customer is prompted to enter a PIN?
The customer can create or update their PIN within the Afterpay app. They click 'How it works' from the Card tab and set or update their PIN from the options.

# What happens when an Afterpay Card declines?
Confirm with the customer that their pre-approved in-store spending limit is sufficient for the purchase. This amount is visible in the Card tab in the customer’s Afterpay App. If issues continue, contact the Afterpay Customer Support team.

# How long will it take the customer to receive their refund?
Once a refund is processed, the payment schedule is updated immediately. It may take up to 10 days for Afterpay to restore funds to the customer's original payment method. The customer may be prompted via the app to follow a guided process to apply the refund to the original order.

# What if the customer's phone doesn't support a digital wallet or NFC?
The customer can contact customer support at 1300 100 729 and select option 6 to speak with a support team member.

# What else should I know about the Afterpay Card?
Ensure your store reviews its internal policy on in-store Afterpay purchases. In some stores, items such as gift cards or lay-by payments cannot be purchased with Afterpay. It is recommended that customers access their Afterpay Card through the Afterpay app to check their pre-approved in-store spend balance and access in-app deals. The Afterpay Card is processed by MasterCard in Australia and Visa in New Zealand; sales and refunds should be processed the same way as any card transactions in-store.
