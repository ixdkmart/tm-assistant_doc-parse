## Preparing for Parental Leave

Under what circumstances can I take Kmart paid parental leave?

Eligible team members can take Kmart paid parental leave if they are giving birth to a child. They can also take it if they are the primary or non-primary carer of the child as applicable. It is available for the adoption of a child under the age of 6. You must have the primary permanent responsibility for the care, development, and upbringing of a child under the age of six. Parental leave is also available in case of stillbirth, premature birth, or if a child passes away in the first 24 months of life.

In the event of a stillbirth or miscarriage, the team member or their spouse or de facto partner is entitled to five days of bereavement leave per occasion.

## Applying for Parental Leave

You must inform your Line Manager at least 3 months before your expected start date of parental leave. You need to complete a Kmart Parental Leave Application form and submit it to your Line Manager. You must also provide either a medical certificate confirming the expected date of birth or relevant medical circumstances, or documentation regarding the expected date of adoption or confirmation of primary responsibility for caring for a child under six.

## Working Up to the Birth

You may work until the birth of your child unless health and safety requirements make working as normal unsafe for you or others.
