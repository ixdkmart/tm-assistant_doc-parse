# Everseen Maintenance Tips

Items such as stickers and signage can affect Everseen. Everseen cameras may detect these causing false alerts that trigger interventions. 

To prevent false alerts, ensure each SCO is clean and free from signage and stickers.

Remove the following examples of signage and stickers:
- Cardboard signage above the SCO
- Signage at the top of the POS screen
- Signage at the front of the SCO scanning bed
- Stickers on the scanning bed
