# Everseen SCO Technology Guide

## Overview
SCO Technology is a software applied to self-serve machines.
It detects specific alerts triggering an intervention.
It provides the SCO team member with a video to identify what has not been scanned correctly.

## Alerts Tracked
No Scans: when a customer misses scanning an item.
Basket Base Loss: when a customer leaves items in the basket not included in the transaction.
Product Switch: when a customer switches an item's barcode.

## No Scans & Basket Base Loss Intervention Process

### Step 1
When a customer transacts on an SCO and one of these occurs:
No Scans or Basket Base Loss.

### Step 2
The SCO triggers an intervention.
The SCO team member must scan their operator barcode to view and investigate the next screen.
The top of the screen shows the alert type (No Scan or Basket Base Loss).
A video shows the item not scanned correctly with a green box highlighting it.

### Step 3

### Step 4
The SCO team member investigates each transaction:
Check the alert type at the top of the screen.
Review the video to identify the cause.
Compare items scanned on the POS with items in the bagging area.
Ensure SCO areas are clean to prevent false triggers.
Multiple interventions may indicate theft.
Know the top 10 product switch products (refer to the Shrink VMB).
If the scanner did not scan the item, rescan it.

Note: SCO team members must watch the video for every intervention.

### Step 5
After identifying the issue, rescanning the items may be necessary.
Choose the appropriate button:
Rescan Item: when a Kmart product has not been scanned or creates an alert.
Rescan not required: if a scanned Kmart or non-Kmart item triggers an alert and does not need rescanning.

### Step 6
Once the intervention is resolved, the customer can proceed with their transaction.

## Product Switch Process
Triggered when a customer switches a barcode to pay less.
Methods include using a barcode sticker, smaller items, or printing barcodes of cheaper products and hiding or placing them on more expensive items.

### How it works:
A list of known product switch items is provided to Everseen.
To register an item, provide the barcode and description.
The system learns the product's appearance from different angles.
It enters go-live mode once learned and triggers alerts on misuse.
Add new items by emailing the barcode and description to lplossbox@kmart.com.au.

## Product Switch Intervention Steps

### Step 1
Customer uses a cheaper product barcode to scan a more expensive item.
This triggers an intervention.
The SCO team member scans their operator barcode to view details.

### Step 2
The screen displays "Product Switch" alert.
A video shows the product switch with a green box highlighting the item.

### Step 3
The team member investigates:
Check the alert type at the top.
Review the video.
Check the scanned items on the POS against items in the bagging area.
Ensure the SCO areas are clean.
Multiple interventions could indicate theft.
Know the top 10 product switch products.

Note: Team members must view the video for every intervention.

### Step 4
Rescan the product switch item correctly.
Verify all other items are correctly scanned.

### Step 6
After resolving the alert, the customer can continue their transaction.

## Customer Service Examples
Always provide good service and avoid accusing customers of wrongdoing.

Scenario 1:
If a customer has already had an intervention for an unscanned item and another occurs, approach and say, "Hi how are you today. It looks like an item didn't scan through. I'll clear this so you can re-scan the item."

Scenario 2:
If a customer scans an incorrect barcode, approach and say, "Hi how are you today. It looks like the item didn't scan properly. I'll clear this so you can re-scan the item."

## Tips for Best Results
Ensure the right team members are trained on SCOs and Everseen.
Check every intervention carefully to reduce shrink.
Keep the SCO area clean to prevent false alerts.
Assist customers in using the SCO correctly.
If no alerts or videos appear, raise an incident report with the IT service desk immediately.
