# DC Rush Process Control Guidelines

## DC Rush Process

A Rush Order is inventory that is sent out to stores when it isn't allocated to, or demanded by stores due to another business driver.

There are five key business drivers that necessitate Rush Orders.

Support DC racking utilisation and optimisation to keep the DC operating.

Reduce multiple supply chain touchpoints of inventory.

Support unforecasted sales demand.

Assist stores in filling bulk or high selling ends quickly.

Support sales of seasonal stock spikes.

Items sent out as part of a rush order generally fall into these categories:

Pallets of inventory that are not using full storage capacity in the DC racking such as:

Oddments, which are inventory in racking that is less than one case per store based on the store rush list.

Residual inventory, which is remaining inventory post-unpack without allocation or demand, less than Ti/Hi.

Inventory with a high sell-through rate such as:

Seasonal inventory that is selling well due to the time of year, e.g., heaters in winter.

Store DC rush inventory requested by stores for quick filling of bulk ends, e.g., microwaves.

Major events inventory associated with current major events to support sales demand, e.g., butane gas canisters for disaster relief.

Ti/Hi refers to the number of cartons stacked on a layer or tier (Ti), and the number of layers high the cartons can be stacked on the pallet (Hi), before reaching maximum capacity.

### 4. Store DC Rush Process

Frequency: Low

Approval: Store Operations Manager (SOM) documented approval

Max: Up to 1 pallet of big and bulky items or 2-3 cartons

## Controlling Rush Ordering Going Forward

DCs will follow the procedural controls, including appropriate sign-off on all Rush Orders.

DCs will communicate plans for sending bulk rush orders to stores before loading to ensure stores can hold the inventory, reducing returns due to congestion in back-of-house areas.

Stores are encouraged to request high-selling bulk inventory more frequently to enable DCs to send inventory to the correct stores at appropriate times instead of to stores lacking capacity.

## DC Escalation Process for Non-demanded or Unallocated Apparel

If a request is outside of the approved rush control guidelines:

The DC will escalate the issue to the Inventory team on the day of unpacking.

An email request must be sent to the inventory queries inbox at inventoryqueries@kmart.com.au.

The email must include the order number, keycode, and shippers.
