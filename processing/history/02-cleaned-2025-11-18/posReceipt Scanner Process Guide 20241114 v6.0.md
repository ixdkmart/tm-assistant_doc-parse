# Receipt Scanner Process Guide

A new function has been added to store PDT devices within the store application called the 'Receipt Scanner.' It is to be used by Customer Greeters to scan the barcode of a customer receipt upon exit to validate the location, date, and time.

These checks must be conducted alongside greeting customers upon entry and exit, and checking that the total number of purchased items on the receipt matches the items being taken out of the store. This guide outlines the functions and process for using this application.

## Receipt Scanner App Alert Types

Each time a receipt is scanned for validation, the app checks for correct location, date, and time. It displays alerts to show the required action while validating receipts and customer purchases upon exiting the store.

Green Alert = Valid Receipt  
A green alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with a tick and 'Valid Receipt' message. This validates that the receipt was purchased in your store, with your store number appearing under the green banner on the left side of the screen. It also confirms that items were purchased within 5 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation, shown under the green banner on the right side of the screen.

Amber Alert = Check Items  
An amber alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with an exclamation mark and 'Check Item’s' message. This indicates that the receipt was purchased in your store, with your store number under the amber banner on the left side of the screen. It also shows that items were purchased between 5 to 20 minutes before validation, displayed under the amber banner on the right side. This alert requires further checks to validate purchases.

Red Alert = Invalid Receipt  
A red alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with a cross and 'Invalid Receipt' message. This indicates that the receipt is not from your store, with the store number appearing under the red banner on the left side of the screen. Non-Kmart receipts will not show a number. It also indicates that items were purchased after 20 minutes of presenting the receipt, or on a different date, shown under the red banner on the right side. This alert requires further investigation.

# How to Use the Receipt Scanner App

1. Every Customer Greeter must be provided with a fully charged PDT device at the start of their shift to use the Receipt Scanner via the Store app.

2. Log into the PDT device, select the 'Store' app, then go to Customer Services, and choose the 'Receipt Scanner' option.

3. As customers approach exit, ask to scan their receipt by scanning the barcode on the bottom of the receipt.

The receipt scanner will validate only the location, date, and time of purchase. Support this by checking that the total number of items purchased on the receipt matches the number of items being taken out of the store. The total items purchased are located in the middle of the receipt in bold text.

4. Review the alert displayed on the screen and manage each alert as required.

If the customer has the Kmart app and a digital receipt, scan the barcode like the paper receipt and perform the same checks.

# Managing Receipt Scanner Alerts

Each alert requires a different response. Follow these instructions for each scenario and communicate appropriately with customers.

Always follow the 4D's and notify your manager if faced with a threatening situation.

## Green Alert: Valid Receipt  
1. When a customer approaches the exit, greet and request to see their receipt, e.g., "Hello, may I please scan your receipt."  
2. Scan the barcode.  
3. If a green alert displays, check that the products in the customer's possession match the receipt.  
4. After completing checks, bid farewell, e.g., "Have a great day."

## Amber Alert: Check Items  
1. Greet the customer and request their receipt.  
2. Scan the barcode.  
3. If an amber alert appears, verify that products match the receipt.  
4. If items in possession are not on the receipt, inform the customer and ask them to return to pay.  
5. Complete checks and say farewell.

## Red Alert: Invalid Receipt  
1. Greet the customer and scan the receipt barcode.  
2. If a red alert appears, verify that the store listing matches your store, check the date and time of purchase.  
3. Ask the customer, "Are you sure this is the correct receipt as it doesn't appear to match the products you purchased today?"  
4. Allow the customer to check and provide the correct receipt or clarify the discrepancy.  
5. If necessary, call a manager immediately and follow the 5D's.

Note: An amber or red alert may not always indicate malicious intent. Some valid reasons include receipts from another store or delayed exits after purchases. Always check receipts and ask questions to clarify.

# Safety

Remember to follow the 4D's if facing a threatening situation and notify your manager immediately.  

Take care of yourself during this task. Tips include warming up before your shift, rotating your hands when scanning to prevent strain, and discussing break times with your manager.

# What If Scenarios

## Prioritizing Tasks  
Ensure every customer is greeted upon entry and exit to create a positive experience and demonstrate focus. Conduct these alongside scanning receipts and bag checks. Position yourself in the middle of entry/exit points to facilitate this.

## Handling Queues  
Queues should be avoided. Use your push-to-talk device to call for assistance and move customers through swiftly.

## Training Requirement  
All Customer Greeters must be trained on the Receipt Scanner app.

## Explaining the Application  
Be transparent with customers: "We scan receipts to validate purchases made in the store."

## Refusal to Scan  
Follow the 4D's if the customer refuses and inform your manager immediately.

## Threatening Situations  
Report to a manager immediately and follow the 4D’s. Document the incident in SolvSafety.

## Stock Left at Entry  
Report such incidents using the LP Incident forms and inform your manager to enter details into Auror.

## Digital Receipts  
For customers with a digital receipt from the Kmart app, scan the barcode and follow the same process as with paper receipts.
