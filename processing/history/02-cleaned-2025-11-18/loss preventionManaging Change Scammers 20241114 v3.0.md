# Managing Change Scammers

A change scam is when a customer attends a manned register, using cash as payment, and then attempts to confuse a Kmart Team Member with continuous requests for change.  

They are very confident and usually target younger or new Team Members. They typically purchase low-value items with large denomination notes ($50 or $100 notes).  

Situations include quickly hiding some of the change given and making out they did not receive their change.  

Typically, the change scammer begins by trying to pay for a low-priced item or asking to make change using a large note ($50s and $100s most commonly).  

After the Team Member has opened the register drawer and begun to count out the change, the change scammer will interrupt and request different denominations.  

As the Team Member goes back to the register drawer to get the correct notes, the request will change again.  

Often, at this point, the change scammer will produce another note (a small one) and ask for the original large note back.  

## How to Manage a Change Scammer Steps

Step 1: When providing change, always count the change back to the customer.  

Step 2: Close the register immediately once the change is provided.  

Step 3: If a customer requests further change, slow down and take your time to provide the change, counting back the required change to them.  

Step 4: If a customer disputes the change provided, close the register immediately and call a manager for assistance.
