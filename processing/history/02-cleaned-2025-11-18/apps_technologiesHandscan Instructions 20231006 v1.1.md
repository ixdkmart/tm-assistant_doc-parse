## Handscan / Save & Finalise

Open the RFID App and select the 'Count Capture' tile.

Scroll through left to right the 'Storage selection' until you find the container you wish to handscan into.

Start hand scanning by pulling the trigger on the RFID wand. Watch the EPC tag count increase as new tags are recognised. The hand scan will only recognise new tags that have not been read by the Tory Robot.

When you have captured all the tags, press 'FINALISE'. If you realise you have been scanning into the wrong container, press the 'reset' button to start again.

Press 'YES' to confirm.

From the home screen, select the 'Inventory Summary' tile.

If the 'SAVE & FINALISE' button appears greyed out, it indicates EPC tags are still processing in the background. Pull down the screen to refresh until the button appears clickable.

Press the 'SAVE & FINALISE' button.

Press 'YES, CONTINUE' to confirm.

Backfill tasks should generate after approximately 10 minutes.
