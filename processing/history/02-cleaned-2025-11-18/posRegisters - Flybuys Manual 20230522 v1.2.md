## Introduction
FlyBuys is an incentive scheme available to individuals but not companies.  
FlyBuys rewards customers by issuing points for purchases in Kmart stores and other Coles Group businesses.  
FlyBuys cardholders receive a statement every two months showing their points.  
Customers can exchange points for free air travel and other products.

## How FlyBuys works
Customers can apply for a FlyBuys card at any Kmart store.  
Customers must complete an application form before receiving the card.  
Customers can present their FlyBuys card during the transaction up to and including the point where the Customer Service Operator (CSO) presses Total.  
FlyBuys points are awarded based on the total purchases made in one store on one day.  
For layby purchases, points are not processed until the layby is completed.

## Ineligible transactions
Points are not awarded for gift card purchases, but points do apply on redemption of the card.  
Points are not awarded for third-party vendor items, such as purchases from PixiFoto.  
Points are not awarded for items purchased under non-merchandise or sundry codes, like delivery charges.  
Points are not awarded for laybys started before the customer joined the scheme.  
Points are not awarded for purchases charged to a customer account.  
Points are not awarded for payment for repaired goods.  
Points are not awarded for freight charges listed separately.  
Points are not awarded for layby service fees.  
Points are not awarded for purchases made off-site, such as at camping exhibitions.  
Points are not awarded for Coles Group Source MasterCard credit card payments.

Kmart team members cannot use FlyBuys cards in conjunction with:  
Company purchases, such as milk for the tea room.  
The company Visa card, such as food purchases when travelling for business.
