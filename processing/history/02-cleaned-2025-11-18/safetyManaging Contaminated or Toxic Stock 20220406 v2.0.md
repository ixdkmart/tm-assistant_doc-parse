# Managing Contaminated or Toxic Stock

Contaminated or toxic stock sent to our stores is a rare instance.  
If stock is identified as contaminated or toxic, extreme caution is required to ensure safety.  
This guide outlines the process of identifying such stock and the steps to isolate it, inform relevant areas, and dispose of it safely.  
Contaminated or toxic stock excludes mouldy stock and insect infestations, which are managed separately.

## Identify & Report an Incident Process

1. Stock is identified as contaminated or toxic, for example, if it has an offensive or distinct smell or is visually apparent.  
The team member must alert a manager immediately.  
2. Do not touch the stock. Isolate it and place signs on it to prevent others from touching.  
Signs should read: "WARNING - Contaminated products - DO NOT TOUCH."  
Create and print the signs on A4 paper, with enough copies to cover each side of the stock or container.  
3. Using PPE such as masks, gloves, and goggles, move the stock into a secure location.  
Ensure the isolating signs are on all sides of the stock.  
Consult your manager about the storage location and any additional controls needed, such as storing away from ignition sources, near emergency response equipment, or in a well-ventilated area.  
4. Raise the issue as a safety hazard via Solvsafety - Health & Safety Central.  
5. Call your Safety Manager and Loss Prevention Business Partner to advise them of the incident.  
The Safety Manager or Head of Health & Safety will contact the Head of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs to inform them of the incident.  
Support may include ensuring safety for team and customers, storage considerations, testing the stock, removing it, adjusting stock records, and gathering cost impacts for insurance claims.  
6. Wait for instructions from your Loss Prevention Business Partner on completing stock adjustments.

## Adjusting Contaminated or Toxic Stock

It is essential to update the system to reflect contaminated or toxic stock to ensure accurate stock levels and support insurance claims.  
For large volumes, contact your Loss Prevention Business Partner, who may involve the National Office to assist with adjustments.

1. Confirm the stock has been receipted into the system.  
2. Wait for approval from your Loss Prevention Business Partner to adjust the stock under code 27 (Fire/Water/Natural Disaster).  
3. Identify the stock to be adjusted:  
If identifiable through your manifest, highlight and apply the adjustments.  
If not, conduct a gap scan of the stock on the shop floor and in the stockroom and adjust for differences.  
If the volume is large, provide the following details to your Loss Prevention Business Partner: the date received, consignment note number, manifest number, keycodes, style codes, quantity (optional), and whether it is a full load or an estimated number of units.
