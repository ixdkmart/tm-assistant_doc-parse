# Soiled & Damaged Clearance End Tips

It is important to review all soiled and damaged (S&D) stock daily. 
Markup the price of these products wherever possible to avoid shrinkage.
This guide provides tips for managing S&D products.
Clearance end setups as outlined in this guide are mandatory in all stores.

## S&D Products That Cannot Be Sold

Returned undergarments such as underwear, lingerie, and swimwear cannot be sold.  
Apparel that is stained or damaged, such as a tear in the material, chemical marks, sweat, body fluids or markings, or used, cannot be sold.  
Faulty, returned, or display electrical products cannot be sold.  
Products missing safety or compliance warning information labels cannot be sold.  
Products containing sharp or dangerous parts or substances, including broken glass, cannot be sold.  
Products deemed unsafe to sell due to missing parts or damaged parts cannot be sold.  
Products in breach of health and safety regulations, such as open cosmetics or grocery items, cannot be sold.  
Toys where damage poses a choking hazard or risk of injury cannot be sold.

## S&D Clearance Markdown Criteria & Schedule

When a product is safe to be resold as soiled and damaged, it can be marked down according to the RLO assessment process.

The first S&D markdown is 50% off the original sell price and applies when the product is identified as S&D.  
The second markdown is 50% off the previous markdown price, and it occurs 2 days after the first markdown.  
Additional markdowns are 50% off the previous markdown price, and they occur 2 days after the second markdown.  
If the product does not sell, it should be scanned into the salvage bin during RLO assessment. In NZ stores, write-off is done under RLO.

## S&D Clearance End Presentation

Products should be neat, tidy, and placed on an end.  
Yellow labels must clearly indicate the reason for markdown and the price.  
Packaging must be marked with a suffocation warning label.  
Big and bulky items must be displayed in their designated home location.

## How Not to Present

A messy clearance area will not attract customers to view and purchase products.  
Clearance items must be on an end and not in a trolley.  
Unclear yellow labels may deter customers from purchasing.  
Big and bulky items must be displayed in their designated home location.
