# Important Reminder

Check every intervention carefully.  
All SCO team members must check every intervention to ensure the correct products are scanned. This ensures the system works accurately and reduces shrink in your store.

Maintain the SCO area.  
For the technology to work accurately, the SCO area must be kept clean. Make sure there are no receipts, hangers, products, or rubbish left on the SCOs that the cameras can detect, creating a false alert.

Customer Service.  
Assist customers and ensure they use the SCO correctly, placing items in the staging area and placing scanned items only into the bagging area. This will prevent false alerts.

Customer Enquiries.  
If a customer asks about Everseen, direct them to the signage at the entry to the SCO and front of store. If unsure, always ask a manager for help.

System Observations.  
Check the SCOs each day to ensure Everseen is working by attempting a no scan. Try this two times on the same SCO. If Everseen is not triggering alerts or showing a video, report it immediately to your manager to log with the IT service desk.
