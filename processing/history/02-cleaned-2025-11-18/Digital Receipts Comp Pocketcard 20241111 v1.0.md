# Purpose
We enable our in-store team members to promote Digital Receipts and enhance Kmart app adoption. This facilitates seamless returns and exchanges.

The program also aims to raise awareness and educate customers about additional Kmart app features, including the price scanner, wish list, and the convenience of shopping anytime and anywhere.

For AUS Stores Only.

# Promotion
In-store POS methods include price check scanners, Customer Service Desk signage, tea room posters, support card handouts, and SCO bed decals.

Promotion success is measured by digital receipt sends as a percentage of transactions.

# Customer Engagement
Team members should actively engage with customers at key service touchpoints to highlight the advantages of the Kmart app.

The SCO Leader should emphasize in-store promotion of the Kmart app and advocate for digital receipts by distributing support cards with instructions on accessing them.

Assisted Checkout and FlexiPOS staff should inform customers that downloading the Kmart app allows them to store digital receipts within the app when requesting Flybuys.

At the Service Desk, staff should encourage the use of the app while assisting with returns or exchanges.

On the shop floor, if a customer requests price or product information, staff should promote the product scanner feature available on the Kmart app.
