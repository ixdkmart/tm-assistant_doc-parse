# Buddy Guide: The Role of a Buddy

## Introduction

Welcome to the Buddy program. Thank you for helping make a new starter's induction experience a great one.

The buddy program connects new team members with existing team members. This ensures that newly hired team members are quickly and effectively integrated into their new team.

Buddies complement the induction process by working alongside new team members to ensure they feel welcome and included in the new team.

As a buddy, you will act as an ambassador for a new team member. You will communicate the organisation's culture and relate job and non-job specific information. A buddy should be accessible to the new starter. You should have the time to perform this role and should not be on leave during the first critical weeks. Doing so may leave the new hire feeling stranded.

A buddy provides moral support during the first few weeks. They introduce the new starter to team members and show them around their new workplace.

The buddy relationship is not the same as that of a manager. Your role is to be a supportive colleague and friendly face.

## Your Responsibilities

Your role as a buddy is to support the new starter by helping them navigate their way around the store or office. This could include demonstrating aspects of their role or checking that they meet deadlines.

Answer questions, often more than once. Be patient, as new starters take in a lot of information and may need to re-ask questions.

Provide information, help navigate resources, and offer informal support.

Introduce the new starter to other team members important to their role.

Help them understand the formal and informal culture and structures at Kmart Target.

Encourage the new starter to ask questions if they are unsure about any aspects of their role.

Arrange with their manager a way to celebrate the new starter after a set period so they can be recognized and feel part of the team.

The buddy is not a line manager, a direct report, a professional counsellor, or a career mentor.

Will I fit in? Will I be welcome?

Our team is only as good as the effort we put into them. No question is a silly question.

## The 3-Phase Relationship

Your buddy relationship will go through three phases: the welcome, the check-ins, and an ongoing connection.

Develop a relationship organically. Let it happen naturally rather than forcing it.

Make this buddy program your own. Have fun and find the benefits of building a new professional connection.

### Welcome

Make the effort to welcome the new starter. This can be through a text, phone call, or in person.

Aim to have this welcome conversation before day one or within the first week.

Make contact to welcome the new starter to the team.

Spend about 10 minutes each day on this. You can connect by phone, text, or in person.

Refer them to Our Learning Hub (LMS).

Get to know them, their background, and why they are excited to work with us.

### Check-in

In the first few weeks, the new starter will be trying to orient themselves. Take the time to check in.

Regular check-ins are most helpful. Explain company language and answer questions.

Spend about 10 minutes each day checking in. Connect by phone, text, or in person.

Refer them to the company process documents.

Have regular catch-ups to build the relationship. They may not need you every time, but they will appreciate knowing you are there.

### Connect

Stay connected and provide advice as needed.

As the new starter gains more confidence, they will need less guidance. However, continue to stay available for support.

Be available for advice and support on an ad-hoc basis.

Connect by phone, text, or regular catch-ups.

Refer them to relevant programs and additional learning resources.

Get to know their background and what excites them about working with us.
