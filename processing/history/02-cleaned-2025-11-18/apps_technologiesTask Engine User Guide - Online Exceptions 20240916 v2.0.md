# Task Engine Learning Guide

## Accessing the Task Engine application
This application can only be accessed on a TC52 or an upgraded TC51 PDT device. These can be identified by their PDT numbers that will start with either KMPD20 or KMPD30.

## Logging in
Select the Task Engine 'Tasks' application from the PDT. Enter your employee number followed by @kmart.com.au. Enter your password.

## Creating a PIN code
After your first login each day, create a 4-digit PIN code that will last for 24 hours. Create and enter a 4-digit PIN. Press 'Confirm'. The Task Engine main screen will show your PIN has been accepted.

## Re-entering PIN after idle time
If the PDT is idle for 25 minutes, your PIN will need to be used to access the Task Engine. After idle time, enter your 4-digit PIN to access the Task Engine.

## Forgot PIN (PIN reset)
To reset your PIN, select 'I forgot my PIN' and log back in with your employee number followed by @kmart.com.au.

## Task Engine main screen guide
The store number and today's date are displayed, for example, Kmart 1136 • Friday, 8 Dec. The filter function shows the number of tasks, for example, Showing 123 tasks. The initials of the logged-in user are displayed, such as AB.

Task cards show the task description, world, item description, and department. Examples include:
Online exception - HOME
Tami Cotton Quilt Cover Set
00-Bed linen

Markdown sections:
CLOTHING
T1 - 150 units / 23 styles
Womens

Task status is indicated as 'To Do' or 'In Progress'.

Notes include that you can swipe or pull down to refresh the application if no tasks are shown, and that Task Engine fetches new data every 30 seconds.

## Online Exception - completing a task
To filter tasks by World, select the filter function. Choose the desired World and press 'Apply'. Tasks shown will be from that World only. Press 'Clear' to reset.

Open a task to complete by selecting its card. Online exceptions should be completed according to the current process, ensuring 'Confirm' is pressed when finalising each adjustment. When the task is complete, you are automatically returned to the task engine home screen.

## Logging out
Select your initials from the top right, then choose 'Log out'. The screen will show that all tasks are complete.

## Troubleshooting
Follow these steps for the following error messages:
