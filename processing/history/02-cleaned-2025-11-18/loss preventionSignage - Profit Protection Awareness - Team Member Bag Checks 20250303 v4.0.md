# Have you got Profit Protection awareness?

## Team Member Bag Checks

To develop a culture of security awareness, every Kmart employee must present their bag(s) upon exiting a store on all occasions.

If you identify any issues or a Kmart employee refuses this check, contact your manager immediately.

If you do not feel comfortable raising suspicious behaviour with a manager, you can contact the Speak Up Hotline.

### SAY Something

Report suspicious behaviour through the following ways:

You should report any suspicious or unusual behaviour to your manager or confidentially through the Speak Up service. All matters raised are kept confidential, protecting those who raise concerns or allegations.

You can talk to your line manager or store manager.

You can report online at https://kmart.com.au/speakup.

You can call the hotline in Australia at 1800 518 230 or in New Zealand at 0800 753 231.
