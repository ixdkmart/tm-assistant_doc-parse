# Duress Button User Guide

A Duress button, also known as a panic button or panic alarm button, is an electronic device designed to alert Kmart's security monitoring company, Chubb Security, in emergency situations where a threat to team members or property exists.

The Duress button is located within the store's register area. Store leadership teams must ensure all team members know the location of the duress button and when it should be used.

The Duress Button key must be placed onto a key ring and added to the key cabinet and key register. Do not leave the key in the duress button.
