# Social Q - Virtual Queue

## Required Equipment

To start using Social Q, you need a PDT, tablet, or store mobile phone, a pen, and raffle tickets.

## Positioning Signage

The five large Tri Signs must be strategically positioned outside the store displaying 'Don't want to Queue.'

## Managing Queue Capacity

When the store or physical queue reaches capacity, the queue controller will flip the double-sided Tri Signs to 'Store at Capacity.'

They will then collect the required equipment and commence a virtual queue using Social Q.

## Raffle Tickets

The queue manager will use raffle tickets for customers who do not have a phone.

## Customer Entry and Virtual Queueing

When the next customer arrives, inform them that the store or physical queue is at capacity.

They must join the virtual queue or book via Social Q to enter.

Customers have two options in Social Q: 

They can choose to join immediately ('Now') or schedule a later time ('Later').

If the customer chooses 'Now', they can scan the QR code or enter the web address on one of the Tri Signs and wait to be notified via SMS.

If the customer chooses 'Later,' they select a time slot for their visit, then leave and return at the booked time.

## Adding Customers Without Phones

If a customer does not have access to a phone, a team member can add a booking by pressing 'add booking,' entering the customer's name and raffle ticket number in the name field, leaving the mobile number blank.

The raffle ticket is then issued to the customer, who must wait nearby until their raffle number is called.

## Managing the Virtual Queue

The queue controller must liaise with the team member counting customers.

They will check bookings and send SMS invitations to customers.

## Queue Status Indicators

Grey indicates customers already in store.

Yellow indicates customers who have arrived and are in the queue.

White indicates customers who have booked but not yet arrived.

## Notifying Customers

For walk-up customers, when capacity is available, press 'send SMS reminder' to notify them. They will show the confirmation screen to the queue controller.

For booked customers, when capacity is available, press 'send SMS reminder.' When they arrive, they click 'arrived,' moving them to the top of the queue.

The queue controller then marks the customer as in store.

## Hygiene Procedures

Follow good hygiene principles and regularly clean equipment.

Wash hands at regular intervals throughout your shift.

Wipe down equipment with a paper towel and antibacterial spray as needed.

Wear disposable gloves and change them frequently during your shift, disposing of used gloves in a labelled bin with no lid.

Equipment should be wiped down regularly or when swapping with another team member.
