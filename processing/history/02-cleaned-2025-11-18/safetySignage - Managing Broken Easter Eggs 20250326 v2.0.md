# Managing Broken Easter Eggs

Broken and damaged Easter eggs contribute to large volumes of shrink at Easter. Follow these procedures when this occurs:

For broken or half-eaten Easter eggs, write the barcode on the soiled and damaged sheet and dispose of the eggs in the rubbish bin. When adjusting, write off on the PDT under Soiled and Damaged.

For empty Easter egg packets, if eggs are missing and only wrappers or packets remain, place the empty packets into the empty packet bin. When adjusting, write off on the PDT under Empty Packets.

For packets of eggs with some missing, do not eat or share the eggs. They must be written off and disposed of in the rubbish bin. When adjusting, write off on the PDT under Soiled and Damaged.

For eggs received in delivery that are damaged, do not eat or share the eggs. Write them off and dispose of in the rubbish bin. When adjusting, write off on the PDT under DC Soiled and Damaged. If the delivery arrives with a shortage, adjust on the PDT under Inner Carton Adjustment.
