# EAS Hard Tag Reuse Process

Follow these steps to return all EAS hard tags and pin sets for reuse by suppliers.  
This process is for hard tags and pins only. It does not apply to other Loss Prevention materials such as Spiderwraps, AutoPegs, and Security Cases.

## Step 1  
Set up a small online box and place one Security Tags Enclosed sticker on the side of the carton.  
If a small online box cannot be sourced, substitute with another box no greater than 30cm x 30cm x 30cm.  
It is important that these dimensions are followed to comply with international transport requirements.

## Step 2  
At the registers, service desk, or online processing area, after removing EAS hard tags, store the hard tags and pins together.  
Do not connect the pin to the tag.  
Sort these sets from spider wraps, auto pegs, and other reusable tagging materials.  
Register drawers can hold two containers that are 10cm wide.

## Step 3  
Transfer the EAS security tag sets, including the tag and pin, from service areas into the prepared 30cm x 30cm x 30cm box.  
Continue this process until the box is full.  
Once full, seal the box with tape.

## Step 4  
Place the box on top of the full hanger box.  
Ensure the Security Tags Enclosed sticker is facing outward for easy identification.  
Secure the box to the lid with tape to hold it during transport.

## Step 5  
Backload the box to the Distribution Centre, following the current process.  
Record on the W52 that a hanger pallet has been returned.
