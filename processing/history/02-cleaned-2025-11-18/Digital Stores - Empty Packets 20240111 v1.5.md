# Apparel Empty Packets Process

## Apparel Empty Packets

The process ensures effective management of tags to maintain accurate inventory and quality digital tasks.

An empty packet indicates merchandise has been stolen, such as when an apparel tag is concealed. Managing these tags correctly is critical to ensure accurate inventory counts and proper handling of the items, such as used in backfill tasks.

Check hot spot areas for empty packets, as RFID kimble tags are read by Tory, not the item itself. Hot spot areas include change rooms (behind mirrors, under fitting room seating), the back of bike units, shed area (home décor), cosmetics area, areas with low customer traffic, and back of house areas like stock rooms and tea rooms.

Required equipment includes scissors, gloves, and a tagging gun to reapply kimble tags.

Signage Action: Laminated signage must be placed in the Empty Packets area.

Known Shrinkage Action: If RFID kimble tags are found in hot spot areas and are identified as theft, follow the Empty Packets Adjustment Process.

### Apparel Empty Packets Process

Unknown Shrinkage Action:

Step 1:
If kimble tags are found on the floor around or directly under the product location, attempt to locate and reattach the tag to the product using a tagging gun and gloves.

Step 2:
If the RFID kimble tag is found but the item cannot be located, the tag must be cut in half from top to bottom before the next Tory run so it isn't counted. Wear gloves to perform this process.

Step 3:
Dispose of the cut RFID kimble tag in the rubbish bin.
