Cash counts off / on compared to ensure the count is correct, i.e., Register bag in correct register. Check yesterday's count off to today's count on, via the Escape system.

EFT Tender checked against EFT Net Sales on SATR. EFT figure – CG Card – Gift Card should equal EFT Net Sales.

On the Spot Balance spreadsheet, check that the Open Cash / Float figure is entered correctly. This will usually show up as a Monday error. Check last week's K162 slip for the Balance figure under the Office count section. This should be the same figure. Check the Escape system Sunday for count off and Monday for count on.

Are all cheques accounted for? Verify by checking all cheques listed on the SATR balance to Register Clearance Book entries (NCM stores) or Clearance tab (CM stores). Cheques could still be in the register or with EFT validation slips. If you locate any, note the register number and pass to the Office team to include with the next day's work; this will then balance the register the following day.

Review the previous redeemed e-Voucher entries by register in the Register Clearance Book (NCM stores) or Clearance tab (CM stores), and verify with SATR. Ensure the actual SATR for each register is used, not the Recap Read.

Are there any Cash Office dockets for clearance or front end errors? Ask Cash Office members if there are petty cash dockets being held in the Office that could relate to the registers. For example, if a register is short of $150 and there is a clearance error of $150 over, this could relate to that register.

Has the Cash Office actioned the EFT Cash Out form and it was sent to the correct register?

Are all Code 10 bags accounted for? From Escape, call up all 'Code 10's' for that register for that day and check slips held in Cash Office. Confirm all cash has been removed from the Code 10 bag. Ask Cash Office members or SAM to check all blue bags.

Has the previous total of 10 Non Sales been correctly voided for all registers except Lay-by? All dockets should have 'Operation Complete'. Check this on Escape. If Transaction Voided is noted, you will need to process either as a refund or as a sale to correct it. Check if a team member has tried to total 10 a completed EFT transaction, including refunds, as these cannot be voided. They must be refunded and re-rung. If on a refund register, the item should be resold then refunded again. Verify that voided cash e-vouchers on refund registers have been processed correctly.

Check under the register drawer or around the register area for cash or cheques. If found, note the register number and hand to Cash Office to include in the next day's work.

Has a refund been performed on a non-refund register? Check if the refund has a corresponding compensating sale (Dept 95 transaction reversal). If not, determine why the refund was performed.

Has a void from the previous week been corrected this week? Check with SAM to confirm if she/he has corrected errors from previous weeks.

For Layby registers, review Escape to ensure all new charges have been processed correctly if there is a register error on a Layby register.

File this with the SATR and Spot Balance information.

Note: These are basic checks that may assist in error investigations. Cash comparisons may need to be completed.
