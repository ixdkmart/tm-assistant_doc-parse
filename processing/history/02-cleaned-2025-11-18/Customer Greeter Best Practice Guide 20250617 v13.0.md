# Customer Greeter Best Practice Guide

## Standards, role requirements and responsibilities of the Customer Greeter

### Rostering Standards

When rostering for the customer greeter role, managers must ensure that a customer greeter is rostered during all trading hours in a store. Two customer greeters should be rostered for core and peak trading periods. All customer greeters must provide updates regarding product changes, store layout changes, and conduct a store walk to visually identify any changes. One duty of managers is to make themselves known to the customer greeter. Ensure the Customer Greeter completes a warm-up as per the Warm-Up's Poster before their shift and regularly walks around the customer greeter area to maintain stretching. When a customer greeter is on a break, the replacement must have completed the minimum training standards listed below.

### Minimum Training Standards

All team members rostered as customer greeters must have completed the following training: the Customer Greeter and bag check module, the Managing Threatening Situations.Kmart Way module, and the Visitor management module in LMS prior to rostering. The customer greeter must read, understand, and comply with the No Apprehension Policy, Threatening Situations 4Ds, and Receipt Scanner Process Guide.

### Equipment Standards

Every customer greeter must have the following equipment: a blue vest, Push 2 talk units (P2T), a PDT device for receipt scanning, a duress watch where applicable, a safety camera where applicable, and a Kmart utility belt holding checkseals, a pen, customer service forms, LP incident reporting forms, and a portable EAS retractable de-tagger.

## Role Requirements

The customer greeter must be friendly, knowledgeable, assertive, confident, and have positive body language. They should be positioned as shown in diagram examples on page 3. One option is a single greeter during low and medium traffic times, standing to the left where customers exit to check receipts and bags and farewell customers, while roaming the area to greet customers entering. The other option is two greeters during high and peak traffic times, with one at the entry greeting customers and roaming to greet entering and exiting customers, and one at the exit checking bags, receipts, and farewelling customers while roaming. All threatening situations must be reported via the Safety Solvsafety portal. Service standards must be adhered to at all times. Profit protection incidents should be reported to a manager for incident reporting. EAS gates must be tested daily, and reports made if they are not working.

## Customer Service Standards

### Entry and Exit

Greet each customer with a smile and welcoming language when they enter. Farewell each customer and ask if they found everything they were looking for when they exit. Assist customers with inquiries such as location of products or directing them to the Service Desk for refunds/exchanges, and alert the team via P2T. Request receipts to be scanned according to the receipt scan process and ensure bag checks match items on the receipt. Reports of suspicious behavior should be made discreetly using the P2T, following the Managing Threatening Situations - 4Ds Poster. Manage visitors and contractors by informing the management team, ensuring they scan in and out using the Verified QR code, and applying checkseals on their goods.

Monitor trolley and basket availability; notify a manager via P2T if replenishment is required. When appropriate, ask for assistance to queue bust while checking receipts.

If any Customer Service Standard creates a threatening situation or results in aggressive behavior, always adhere to the 5D's and report the incident to a manager discreetly.

## Tasks Not to Be Allocated to Customer Greeters

Tasks outside the listed responsibilities should not be assigned to customer greeters. These include merchandising such as folding apparel, applying merch protection, click and collect pickup, price markdowns, escorting customers to other areas, and layby pickup.

## Store Layout and Positioning for Greeters

### Option 1 - One Customer Greeter

During low and medium traffic times, one greeter stands to the left side where customers exit to check receipts and bags and farewells customers, while roaming to greet entering customers.

### Option 2 - Two Customer Greeters

During high and peak traffic times, one greeter at the entry greets customers and roams to greet entering and exiting customers. The other greeter at the exit checks bags, receipts, and farewells customers while roaming.
