Select a markdown task from the Task Engine home screen.

Always select the top task card or tasks allocated from your manager.

If you have an 'In progress' task, complete it before selecting another.

Use the filter function to show only Markdown tasks if needed.

From the list view, select the first style to follow the most efficient route.

Scroll if necessary to see all styles.

Note: You cannot scan an item from this screen.

Product details include description, style number, type, now price, was price, department, class, units in task, sold since last Tory run, and keycodes.

Use the information to locate the correct style and keycode.

Scan to confirm the correct style and keycode have been located.

Review the list of keycodes if only one is listed; if multiple, scan one of the keycodes.

Use the provided interactions: enlarge images, close images, view location maps, and use the map zoom features.

If the style/keycode cannot be located, press the back button and select the next style from the list.

Locate all units in the task.

Apply new prices to the kimble tag, including shelf talker, then press 'Done' to complete.

Repeat the process for all styles until the task is complete.

If all units are not found, you can proceed to the next style.
