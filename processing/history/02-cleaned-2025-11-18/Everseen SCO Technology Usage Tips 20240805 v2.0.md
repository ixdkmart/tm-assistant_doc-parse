# Important Reminder

Check every intervention carefully.  
It is important that all SCO team members check every intervention to ensure the correct products are scanned. This helps the system work accurately and reduces shrink in your store.

Maintain the SCO area.  
For the technology to work accurately, the SCO area must be kept clean. Make sure there are no receipts, hangers, products, or rubbish left on the SCOs that the cameras could detect, which can create false alerts.

Customer Service.  
Assist customers and ensure they use the SCO correctly. They should place items in the staging area and only put scanned items into the bagging area. This prevents false alerts.

Customer Enquiries.  
If a customer asks about Everseen, direct them to the signage at the entry to the SCO and the front of the store. If unsure, always ask a manager for help.

System Observations.  
Check the SCOs each day to ensure Everseen is working by attempting a no scan. Try this two times on the same SCO. If Everseen is not triggering alerts or showing a video, report it immediately to your manager to log with the IT service desk.
