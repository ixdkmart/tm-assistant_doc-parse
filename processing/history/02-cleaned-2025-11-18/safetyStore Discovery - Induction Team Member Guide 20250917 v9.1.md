# Version 4
# September 2025

# Welcome

We are glad you are here.

After completing your mandatory "Kmart new store team member (wages) training" modules in Our Learning Hub, your next step is to attend an in-store induction (store discovery tour). Your store will contact you to arrange this induction. It will occur before you start working at the store.

During your store induction, you will go on a tour of the store. You will learn about the different areas of the store. You will discover important information about working for Kmart. You will learn relevant health and safety procedures, including emergency procedures. You will explore the store with a buddy. You will review our policies and sign the Kmart Code of Conduct and Policy Acknowledgement form.

Your manager and/or buddy will assist you with these steps.

Once you complete the store discovery and induction, both you and your manager must log into the LMS and mark completion for the Safety practical and Store Induction/Discovery using the OJT checklist. Your manager will guide you through this process.

# Purpose of this guide

This guide is optional reading. It summarizes what is covered in your store induction. It highlights key points and contact information for future reference.

# Store Induction Checklist (for Store Managers)

Welcome and introductions should take approximately 10 minutes. You should welcome new team members, acknowledge the country if applicable, introduce the team and store leaders, explain the session's aim and key roles, and check completion of online learning.

For the Union section, allocate 10 minutes. Explain the role of the Union, provide a Union representative speech if in Australia, and hand out SDA pamphlets if in Australia.

The store tour and site safety will take about 30 minutes. The manager will conduct a tour covering facilities, security, access, lockers, parking, after-hours entry, duress alarms (if in Australia), and store areas including back office, repairs, stockroom, layby, receiving bay, rubbish, operations room, decanting, and online area. A welcome card will be handed out, detailing four steps to complete training and noting key contacts.

# Profit protection

Kmart faces losses (shrinkage) from theft, process violations, fraud, cash discrepancies, and damaged goods. These reduce stock availability, impact customer experience, and decrease profit.

To combat shrinkage, follow profit protection policies and procedures. Be aware of surroundings, report suspicions, and review relevant communications. Follow the 5 D's and avoid putting yourself at risk.

# Customer dishonesty

Customer theft includes merchandise theft, refund fraud, unpaid items at self-checkouts, ticket swapping, stock damage, and counterfeits. Be vigilant and discreet. Greet customers warmly, offer assistance, keep the store tidy, and conduct bag checks when appropriate. Alert managers or discreetly report suspicious behaviours. Never put yourself in harm’s way.

# Team member dishonesty

Honest team members abide by codes of conduct but some may commit theft, use merchandise without paying, steal cash, commit refund fraud, or misuse discount cards. Present bags of A4 size or larger when leaving the store. Kmart may conduct random locker checks, with notice provided. Report suspicious activity to the manager or via the Speak Up! Hotline.
