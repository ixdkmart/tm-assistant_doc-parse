# Policy – Family and Domestic Violence Leave

# Introduction and Purpose
Kmart and Target (together referred to as "the Company") acknowledge that family and domestic violence may directly impact Team Members or their family, including severe health and economic impacts. The Company is committed to assisting Team Members experiencing family or domestic violence to seek professional assistance and to provide support to maintain their ongoing employment. The Company commits to providing a workplace that supports the safety and wellbeing of Team Members who are victims of family or domestic violence, either directly or indirectly. The purpose of this Family and Domestic Violence Leave Policy (Policy) is to provide that support to Team Members experiencing family or domestic violence by providing leave or other support in the workplace.

# Policy Application
This Policy applies to all employees of the Company (Team Members). Where a Team Member's employment is covered by an industrial instrument, such as an enterprise agreement or a modern award, the terms of this Policy will apply to the extent of any inconsistency. However, if this Policy contains a more beneficial term, this Policy will apply to the extent of any inconsistency. This Policy should be used in conjunction with any other relevant policies or procedures. This Policy can be varied or withdrawn at any time and does not form part of, and is not incorporated into, a Team Member's contract of employment.

# Country Application
Australia

# Definitions
For this Policy, family and domestic violence (FDV) means violent, threatening or other abusive behaviour by a close relative of a Team Member, a member of a Team Member's household, or a current or former intimate partner of a Team Member, that seeks to coerce or control the Team Member and that causes them harm or fear.

Close relative includes a spouse (including former spouse), de facto partner (including former de facto partner), child, parent, grandparent, grandchild, or sibling of the Team Member; a child, parent, grandparent, grandchild or sibling of a spouse (including former spouse) or de facto partner (including former de facto partner) of the Team Member; the Team Member; or a person related to the Team Member according to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander kinship rules.

Work Anniversary means the date on which the Team Member's employment started.

# Entitlement
Any Team Member, including casual Team Members, who is experiencing FDV may access up to 10 days paid FDV leave in a 12-month period, in line with the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). FDV leave is available in full when the Team Member starts employment, and the entitlement resets each year on the work anniversary. It may be taken as a single continuous 10-day period, as separate periods of one or more days, or as agreed with the Company, including periods of less than one day. FDV leave does not accrue from year to year.

For full-time and part-time Team Members, FDV leave will be paid at their full rate of pay for the hours they would have worked if not on leave. Casual Team Members will be paid for hours rostered and accepted by them. Casuals can take FDV leave that does not include rostered hours but will not be paid for such periods.

Paid FDV leave may be used when the Team Member is experiencing FDV and needs to do something to address the impact of FDV, which it is impractical to do outside ordinary hours. Examples include relocating or arranging safety measures, attending court hearings, accessing police services, or seeking medical, counselling, financial, or legal assistance relating to FDV.

In addition to FDV leave, Team Members may access other paid leave such as annual leave, long service leave, or personal/carer's leave.

# Notice and Evidence Requirements
A Team Member must notify the Company as soon as practicable about taking FDV leave and specify the expected period of leave. The Company may request reasonable supporting documentation, which may include a document issued by a medical practitioner, police service, court, family violence support service, or a statutory declaration.

# Processing Family and Domestic Violence Leave
When submitting FDV leave into Dimensions or SuccessFactors, use the pay code 'Special Leave' for paid leave. For unpaid FDV leave, use 'Special Leave unpaid'. The 'Special Leave unpaid' code applies when paid entitlement has been exhausted.

# Confidentiality
The Company will treat information related to a support request under this Policy as private and confidential to the extent possible. Disclosure may be made if required by law or necessary to protect life, health, or safety. Information will be restricted to a 'needs to know' basis. Team Members will be consulted about disclosures that seem necessary. All Team Members and line managers must ensure confidentiality and use obtained information only for its intended purpose.

# Requests for Flexible Working Arrangements
A Team Member may request a change in working arrangements under the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) and the Requesting Flexible Working Arrangements Policy. Such requests can be made during working hours.

# Workplace Safety and Security
FDV may be perpetrated against a Team Member or impact them directly at work. Examples include constant contacting, attempts to harm employment relationships, harassment or intimidation at work, and being followed to or from work. Such behaviour may breach court orders or be criminal and affect workplace safety.

The Company may review safety and security needs and implement reasonable measures upon awareness of FDV risks. A key security measure is obtaining permission to hold copies of intervention or restraining orders, allowing prompt reporting of breaches to police. The relevant People and Capability representative or manager can assist with developing a care plan if requested.
