# PDT(TC51) - SIP Softphone - User Guide

Within selected PDTs, a phone app will appear.  
You can make phone calls using this app, just as with a Desk Phone or a DECT cordless phone.

When you first open the app, the page that appears should look like a familiar phone app.

The dialing plan has changed from 3 digits to 7 digits.  
When making an internal call, you must prefix the store number in front of the extension number.

For example, to call 651 at Cranbourne store 1106, you need to dial 1106 followed by 651, making 1106651.

This must be done with every extension within the store, including the PA extension 155.

To identify which extension number you are using, select the default user icon on the top right of the screen.

The displayed extension number will indicate your current extension, such as 1106 670.  
You can also sign out of the extension from this page.
