Yes:

IMPORTANT: Electrical products are not to be tested or re-sold, as electrical exposure is a critical risk.

IMPORTANT: If a product has items missing but the remaining items are in a saleable condition, these should be sold as a soiled and damaged item. This includes sets of glasses where one may be broken but the remaining glasses are in saleable condition. In this instance, you must ensure there are no broken fragments of the broken glass in the box.
