Afterpay allows your customers to take their purchase today and pay in four payments every two weeks. It is always interest-free.

## What is the Afterpay Card?
The Afterpay Card is a contactless digital card stored in a customer's digital wallet on their phone. The customer adds their Afterpay Card to their digital wallet via a one-time setup prompted in their Afterpay App.

## How does a customer use their Afterpay Card to purchase in-store?
The customer can initiate the transaction via the Afterpay app or launch the card directly from their digital wallet. They tap their Afterpay Card on your card terminal to pay and complete the transaction.

## How do I process an Afterpay Card sale in-store?
Process the Afterpay Card purchase the same way as any other contactless card transaction such as Eftpos, Visa, or MasterCard. The customer can initiate the purchase via their Afterpay app or digital wallet. To finalize, they tap their Afterpay Card on your card terminal. The transaction is then complete.

## Is there a minimum spend with Afterpay Card?
Some stores may set a minimum spend with Afterpay. At Kmart, there is no minimum spend in-store with Afterpay.

Refunds are processed the same way as refunds to any Visa or Mastercard in-store.

Then, the customer taps their Afterpay Card on your card terminal to complete the transaction.

Note: If the original sale was made using Afterpay, the refund must go back onto the customer's Afterpay Card and no other tender type.

Cross-check the last four digits on the customer's Afterpay Card with the digits on the receipt.

# Afterpay Card FAQs (continued)

## Can I do a split tender sale with Afterpay Card?
Yes, if your store allows split tender transactions. Enter the amount the customer wishes to spend on their Afterpay Card as a normal card payment. The customer taps their Afterpay Card on the terminal. Process the remaining balance on another tender, such as cash or another card.

## What is the maximum amount a customer can purchase using their Afterpay Card?
This varies for each customer. Customers typically have between $600 and $3000 available to spend. They can view their available to spend amount on the Card tab in their Afterpay app.

## What happens if a customer is prompted to enter a PIN?
Sometimes a PIN is needed after tapping Afterpay Card on the reader. The customer can create or update their PIN within the Afterpay app by clicking 'How it works' in the Card tab and setting or updating the PIN.

## What happens when an Afterpay Card declines?
Confirm with the customer that their pre-approved in-store spending limit is sufficient for the purchase. This limit is visible in the Card tab of the Afterpay app. If issues persist, contact the Afterpay Customer Support team.

## How long will it take the customer to receive their refund?
After the store processes the refund, the payment schedule is instantly updated. It may take up to 10 days for Afterpay to restore funds to the original payment method. Sometimes, the customer will be prompted in the app to follow a guided pop-up to request the refund to the original order.

## What if the customer's phone doesn’t support a digital wallet or NFC?
The customer can call our dedicated support on 1300 100 729 and select option 6 to speak with an Afterpay team member.

## What else should I know about the Afterpay Card?
Ensure your store reviews its internal policy on in-store Afterpay purchases. In some stores, items such as gift cards or lay-by payments cannot be purchased with Afterpay. Customers are recommended to access their Afterpay Card via the Afterpay app to see their pre-approved spend balance and available deals. The Afterpay Card is housed by MasterCard in Australia and Visa in New Zealand, and sales or refunds are processed the same way as any card in-store.
