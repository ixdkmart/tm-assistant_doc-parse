## Automated Clearance & Kmart Resources

Automated clearance is merchandise that has completed the 8-week clearance cycle, is at the oddment stage, has been discontinued, and is managed by Kmart's automated clearance process.

This policy states that:
This merchandise is not to be intentionally held aside for later purchase or until the lowest price point is reached.
Team members are not to make selections directly from the stockroom.
Purchases are not to be made during rostered shifts.
The policy requires notifying the manager when merchandise has missed markdowns or not been placed on display.
It ensures merchandise is marked at realistic prices, and line manager approval is required before purchase.

### Purchasing of automated clearance merchandise

Team members may purchase these items only if the store manager or duty/shift manager has reviewed the price.
The item is obtained from the selling area.
The team member is not on duty.
Purchases are made during trading hours.

Any merchandise that missed previous markdowns must be highlighted to the store manager to ensure appropriate action is taken.

Team members who intentionally hold stock aside for later purchase or until a lower price is achieved violate policy guidelines.

Disciplinary action, including possible termination of employment, will be taken against team members who breach these guidelines.

### Automated clearance policy merchandise pricing policy guidelines

If stock has missed the automated clearance markdown, meaning the merchandise has not been correctly displayed or ticketed, the store manager must be advised.

The store manager or duty/shift manager will review the item and, if appropriate, mark it up to a realistic selling price. They will consider current stock on hand and the saleability of the item.

For example, it may be inappropriate to increase the price on a single garment returned via the service desk or layby. However, if multiple items or a full carton are found on the selling floor or in the stockroom, it may be appropriate to mark up the merchandise. The price should be set to clear the item within 14 days.

The store manager will manually mark the new price on the item and change the flag setting in IPM to 'price required'. This prompts the register operator to enter the set price during sale. Store-initiated price changes are not permitted to manage this merchandise.
