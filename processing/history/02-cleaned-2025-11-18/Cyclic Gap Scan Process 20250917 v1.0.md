# QRC - Cyclic Gap Scan Process

## Introduction

The gap scan function was introduced to address merchandise gaps. It allows shelf edge labels to be scanned and stock on hand (SOH) to be adjusted immediately when differences are found.

Maintaining SOH integrity is critical for effective replenishment in stores and accurate stock levels on the Kmart website. It must be maintained frequently, especially for out of stock (OOS) lines, to achieve the following outcomes: effective and efficient system replenishment resulting in increased in-stock position, increased sales and profits, improved customer service through better range offer and service, and simplification of store processes relying on SOH integrity.

Maintaining SOH integrity also improves processes related to filling, shopkeeping, and online picking.

## Summary of Process

Gap scans must be completed weekly, focusing on specific areas each week, with a full store scan completed over four weeks. There is a provision for targeted departments or store/state-specific focus areas over a five-week period.

The store must break the gap scan areas into departmental sequences, excluding health and beauty, and complete these over the four-week cycle.

A weekly department location refresh should be completed every second week to maximise data and range integrity. This replaces the full store location refresh scheduled quarterly.

The store task tool is updated to include gap scan and location refresh schedules for forward planning.
