# The New 4Ds for Threatening Situations & Lockdowns (Stores)

## Take Care Talk

### Kmart and Target Health & Safety

**To be delivered by:**  
A manager

**What is this team talk about:**  
Managing threatening situations (The 4Ds) and initiating a lockdown.

**Audience:**  
All team members.

**Key messages to be delivered during huddles/team meetings:**  
Threatening situations are common in retail and supply chain sectors. They occur when our team faces acts of violence, aggression, and other crimes. These events can cause serious physical or psychological injury.

We have updated our framework for managing threatening situations based on team feedback and best practice guidance.  

Our managing threatening situations framework is now called the 4Ds, previously known as the 5Ds at Kmart and 3Ds at Target.  

The 4Ds are:  
Distance: Maintain a safe distance from any potentially threatening person or situation to protect yourself. Never follow a threatening person outside the store or try to grab their bag or trolley.  
De-escalate: Remain polite and use a clear, calm voice to prevent the situation from worsening.  
Disengage: If you sense escalation or feel unsafe, remove yourself from the area and notify a manager.  
Debrief: After an event, conduct a wellbeing check for everyone involved and discuss lessons learned as a team.

It is important that all team members and managers are aware of the new 4Ds and understand what they should and should not do in these situations.

Pause and ask the team if they have any questions.

Locking down the store is a control measure to keep everyone safe during serious events, such as an armed person outside the store or a fight or riot outside the store.

A lockbox will be installed at the front of the store for the entry roller door keys. This allows quick access in case of a lockdown.

## When should a lockdown be initiated?  
Any team member or manager can initiate a lockdown. For example, if a customer greeter sees an armed person outside the store, they can initiate a lockdown immediately using the push-to-talk feature to communicate "code lockdown" and describe what is happening and where. This helps managers respond quickly and lockdown the store.

## When should the lockbox be accessed?  
If a manager is not immediately available at the front of the store, they may give the lockbox code to a team member and instruct them to access the lockbox located at the front. This enables the team member to initiate the lockdown response quickly by closing the roller gates or doors.

## Why the Change?  
Feedback from a recent lockdown simulation indicated that the time for a manager to reach the front or access the roller door keys can slow down response times during critical emergencies. Installing a lockbox at the front of the store reduces this delay.

Pause and ask the team if they have any questions.

## What if the armed or violent person is inside our store? Do we still lockdown?  
Lockdown drills protect people from threats outside the site. If a dangerous person is inside:  
Your safety and others' safety are the priority. Evacuate the store if it is safe and possible to do so.  
Do not engage with the dangerous person; this could escalate the situation.  
Call the police immediately, providing details about the situation, the person's location, and description (clothing, weapon).  
If possible, use a duress alarm discreetly to alert authorities without provoking the individual.  
If evacuation is not possible, find a secure location within the store, such as the Safe Zone, back office, storage room, or fitting room.  
Lock the door and barricade it with furniture if possible.  
Silence your phone to avoid detection.  
Stay calm, breathe, and remain quiet, awaiting further instructions from emergency services.

### Wrap-up:  
Recap the 4Ds and Lockdown/Lockbox process.  
Encourage team members to report all threatening situations, big or small.  
Remind the team that no product is worth their life and to practice the 4Ds to stay safe.
