# Bicycle Assembly Process Registers

## Store Area
### Front End and Internal Registers

When work is performed, the customer presents an assembled bicycle at the front end or internal register for purchase.

## Activity Steps

Selling a bicycle:  
The Customer Service Operator removes the Hunter Service Assembly Checklist from all assembled bicycles sold.  
The Customer Service Operator completes the store copy of the Hunter Service Assembly Checklist using a medium black pen, filling in the purchaser's name, address, phone number, purchase date, and store number.  
The store portion of the checklist is retained and placed in the register drawer, then forwarded to the Cash Office for filing.  
The $16.50 assembly fee is processed through the register as a non-merchandise code 2-repair sale. All customers presenting an assembled bicycle for purchase are to be charged the assembly fee unless advised otherwise.  
Customers are not charged for any bicycle repair covered by warranty conditions.  
An assembled bicycle must have the completed Hunter Service checklist attached to be sold.

Charging for assembly or repair:  
The customer is charged the assembly fee when they specifically request to purchase a display model or request to have a model assembled by the Hunter Service representative.
