# SCO Alerts Guide (Reusable Bags & Soda Stream)

The Self-Service Checkouts (SCOs) have alert functions to assist customers and inform Team members about the following:

The bag alert displays an icon at the bottom of the SCO screen showing the number of reusable bags scanned within a purchase.

The Soda Stream alert notifies the SCO Team Member to verify a Soda Stream purchase for an exchange of a cylinder.

This guide provides steps with screenshots demonstrating how each alert appears on the SCO POS screen.

# SCO Bag Alerts

1. The customer scans a product to start a transaction.

2. When a bag is scanned, a quantity of 1 appears in the bag icon at the bottom right of the screen. This helps team members verify that reusable bags have been scanned.

3. It is important to provide good service and avoid accusing customers of wrongdoing. Missed scans can be accidental and should be treated the same way.

4. If a customer has a reusable bag but no quantity is showing in the bag icon, start a conversation with: "Hi how are you today. It looks like your reusable bag didn't scan through. Would you like me to help with this?" Point to the bag icon that shows no bags scanned. Once a bag is scanned, point again to keep the customer informed and help prevent future missed scans.

5. If a customer becomes agitated at any stage, follow the 5D's and report the incident to a manager as soon as possible.

# SCO Soda Stream Alerts

1. The customer taps the screen to start the transaction and selects the 'ReCharge' button at the bottom.

2. The customer chooses 'Soda Stream' from the recharge options.

3. The customer selects 'Soda Stream Refill'. The refilled item appears with a price, asking to place the item into the bagging area of the SCO.

4. An intervention alert is generated for a Team Member to verify that the Soda Stream is a refill, taking the empty cylinder, and then selecting the 'Approved' button to proceed.

5. The verification screen shows the item and total price, with options to assist, and buttons for payment.

6. After verification, the Store Authorization screen displays the total and due amounts, allowing the transaction to continue.
