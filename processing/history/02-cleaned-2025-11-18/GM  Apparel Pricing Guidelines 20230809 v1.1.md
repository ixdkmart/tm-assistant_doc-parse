# Kmart GM & Apparel Pricing Guidelines

The price of standard and seasonal merchandise (status 0, 4, 6) must not be reduced under any circumstances, unless soiled, damaged, or nearing its best before or use by date. Merchandise must be sold at the price set by National Office to ensure profitability is maintained.

## Merchandise Types by Status

Merchandise status and description are as follows:

Status 8: Clearance. End-of-life cycle merchandise managed by National Office.

Status 3: Quit Cycle Clearance. Automated markdown for end-of-life cycle merchandise.

Status 0: Standard merchandise.

Status 4: Allocation. Seasonal, event, and non-standard merchandise.

Status 6: New Line. New 365 merchandise.

When merchandise moves to clearance or quit cycle (status 8 or 3), stores are not permitted to further reduce the price set by the national office until they become oddments or end of range.

This applies for General Merchandise (GM) End of Range when there are minimal units remaining of a clearance or quit cycle keycode and there is no longer adequate space for these on the selling area as replacement new lines have arrived.

For Apparel Merchandise Oddments or End of Range, this applies when there are three or fewer units remaining or a reduced size range (such as only three sizes or less available) of a particular style.

## Steps for reducing prices for end of range

Use a pathfinder or portable barcode printer to re-price the item, placing it over the existing barcode.

Do not reduce the price by more than 50% in the first instance.

Use a generic clearance shelf talker or flip ticket to highlight the new price.

Products should remain within the same location, on the original side (GM) or within the same pad on the back of a gondola (Apparel).

Continue to reduce prices on a weekly basis until sell-through is achieved.
