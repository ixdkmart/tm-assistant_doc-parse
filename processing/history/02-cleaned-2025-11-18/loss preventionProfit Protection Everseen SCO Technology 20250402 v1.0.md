# Overview of Everseen

## What is it?

Everseen is a technology used within the SCOs that detects instances where customers have not scanned products correctly.

No Scan: An item is not scanned and placed into the bagging area.

Basket Base Loss: Items are scanned, and items left in the basket are not paid for at the end of transactions.

Product Switch: A different barcode is used to scan a product.

## What are the Benefits?

It reduces shrinkage created through SCOs.

It improves inventory accuracy by ensuring items are scanned correctly and paid for.

It adds sales by scanning items that are incorrectly or not scanned.

It assists with operational efficiencies, such as SCO service issues and product barcode problems.

# How it Works in Store

## No Scan/Basket Base Loss

Step 1: When a customer doesn't scan an item, an intervention is triggered and video footage of the event is displayed.

Step 2: An SCO team member scans with operator ID and checks the intervention type displayed at the top of the screen.

Step 3: The team member reviews the video and verifies if the products on the screen match what has been scanned. Any items not scanned correctly are rescanned.

The transaction can then be completed as normal.

## Product Switch

Step 1: The customer places the barcode for Colgate toothpaste over the barcode of night wash and puts the item into the bagging area. This triggers a product switch alert.

Step 2: An SCO team member scans with operator ID and checks the intervention type displayed at the top of the screen.

Step 3: The team member reviews the video and verifies if the products on the screen match what has been scanned. Any incorrectly scanned items are rescanned and unwanted items are removed.

The transaction can then be completed as normal.

# Which Button Do I Select?

When to select 'Rescan Item': When a Kmart product has not been scanned, creating an alert (no scan, BBL, or product switch). Select 'Rescan Item'.

When to select 'Rescan Not Required': When a Kmart product triggers an alert but has been scanned and appears on the SCO screen. When a non-Kmart item triggers an alert, such as hangers, phones, coffee cups, or products from other retailers. When a Kmart product triggers an alert due to multiple parts, like a container with a lid. Select 'Rescan Not Required'.

# Thorough investigations of each alert are key

Refer to the top of the screen to identify the alert type, such as mis-scanned item.

Review the video to identify the cause.

Check the list of items scanned on the POS against what is in the bagging area.

Ensure SCO areas are clean to prevent rubbish or hangers from triggering interventions.

Multiple interventions can indicate theft.

Know your top 10 product switch products (refer to the Shrink VMB).

Always blame the machine, not the person, for issues like scanner failures.

# Alert Type: Product Switch

## Scenario:

Customer uses a sticker barcode for a $1 candle on another product. When the alert triggers, they remove the barcode and place it back after the alert is cleared.

## What went wrong?

The screen was not reviewed to identify the intervention type.

The video was not viewed to see what triggered the alert.

Items were not checked against the screen to verify correct scanning.

'Rescan Not Required' was selected when 'Rescan Required' was needed.

The SCO area was messy, with a hanger left in the picking area.

Two team members responded separately to the same alert without following the proper process.

# Alert Type: No Scan

## Scenario:

A customer places the first item in the picking area instead of the bagging area. They attempt to put unscanned items into the bagging area.

## What went right?

The team member sees the intervention and notices items in the pick area.

The video is reviewed.

'Rescan required' is selected to clear the alert.

The team member checks the screen against the bagging area.

The team member identifies unscanned items and rescans them for the customer.

# Alert Type: Product Switch (Detailed Scenario)

A customer scans an item, then tries to scan a second item, triggering an alert. Additional items are placed into the bagging area without scanning.

A green mug triggers a product switch alert due to a $1 candle barcode.

When helmets are scanned, additional alerts occur with the same barcode issue.

The team member assists with scanning items, removing barcode stickers from products such as a mug or a pillow.

Customers realize the product switch attempt is unsuccessful and leave the store empty-handed.

## What went right?

The team member responds to each alert promptly by checking the type.

Each alert video is reviewed carefully.

Displayed items are matched to scanned products, identifying discrepancies.

Products are reviewed, and barcode stickers are removed.

The team member continues assisting with scans after multiple suspicious alerts.

# Getting the Best Results From Everseen

## Right People in the Right Place

Ensure team members are trained on SCOs and Everseen, can manage queues, and know how to investigate alerts.

## Check every intervention carefully

Verify that the correct products are scanned during each intervention to reduce shrinkage.

## Maintain the SCO area

Keep the SCO area clean of receipts, rubbish, products, and hangers to prevent false alerts.

## Customer Service

Assist customers with the SCO system, especially those with large quantities of items, and blame the system, not the person.

## System Observations

If alerts are not appearing, videos are not showing, or alerts are missing from the dashboard, raise an incident with the IT service desk immediately.

## Check the eDashboard

Review weekly video transactions to identify training opportunities and system performance issues.

# Product Switch System Process

## Prerequisites

List of product keycodes sent by Kmart to Everseen, focusing on products used in product switch scenarios (e.g., confectionery, products under $5).

## Data Collection

Review the list to identify products with 80 to 300 scans weekly and send them for processing.

## Process Data

Process the list to enable product learning. Selected products are evaluated and moved to the next stage.

## Evaluate Product Performance

Upload products into Everseen servers to ensure they respond properly. Successful products proceed to 'Go Live'.

## Go Live

Products are added to the live system, which triggers alerts if used for product switch.

This process is continuous, with products removed when switch scans decline and new ones added as the range changes. A list of live products is maintained on Kit.

# Everseen Dashboard

The dashboard allows store leadership to monitor transactions, interventions, and ensure proper procedures.

Access it via the Administration menu on the back-office workstation.

Use the 'Checkout' tab to view transactions.

# Everseen Signage

Signage informing customers about Everseen technology must be placed in the store at all times, checked during Profit Protection reviews and audits.

Procedures:
- Print two copies of the signage in A4 colour.
- Place one near the store entry with the Conditions of Entry signage.
- Place another near the main entry to the SCO area.
- Take photos of both signs.
- Complete an audit by uploading these photos for sign-off.
- Keep the signage displayed and replace as necessary.

## Sign Content

Self-service check-out cameras are used to improve scanning accuracy and manage loss prevention.

They detect missed scans and incorrect scans. The footage shown can be reviewed for self-correction or assistance.

Privacy is protected; footage is top-down, possibly capturing overhead views but not biometrics. Access is limited and footage may be shared with authorities or service providers but is automatically deleted otherwise.

Customers can opt not to use the self-service, and staff will assist them.

The privacy policy is available via a QR code and includes the Kmart logo.

# Everseen Reporting

Weekly reports are sent via email, with upcoming Power BI versions providing additional insights.

Report tabs include:
- NO SCAN (Volume): Counts interventions where no scan occurred.
- NO SCAN ($): Counts interventions by value, assuming $5 sell price.
- Alert Feedback: Shows how interventions were responded to.
- Basket Base Loss: Counts BBL interventions.
- PS (Volume): Counts product switch interventions.
- PS ($): Counts switch interventions by value, averaging $8.63 each.
- Outages: Reports system outages.

Only 60% of no scan interventions are reported to account for false alerts, such as from phones or hangers.

## Alert Feedback

Tracks team responses to interventions, aiming for a 30% rescan rate per store.

Unnecessary rescans are common if no Kmart product is detected, but investigation should reduce this.

A high unclassified rate may indicate system issues and should be reported to IT.
