# Digital & Gift Receipts

## Digital Receipts

### Scenario
Which customer can get a digital receipt?
1. OnePass customers who have linked to their Kmart account.
2. Flybuys customers who have linked to their Kmart account.
3. NAB customers who have opted into 'Slyp Smart Receipts'.

### Changes to the in-store process
There will be no changes to the in-store process, and customers will still receive a paper receipt. Customers may show digital receipts for refunds. It is unlikely a customer will exit with only a digital receipt.

### Changes to the refund process
When requesting a refund, the customer can present a printed receipt or show a digital copy directly from their phone. If a customer shows a digital receipt, the barcode can be scanned using POS scanners to process the refund as normal. If the barcode cannot be scanned, team members can manually enter the receipt details into the POS to pull up the transaction and process the refund, using the transaction number, store number, and register number as needed.

### What to do if the barcode on the digital receipt won't scan
Refer to the image showing the receipt and POS screen with labeled fields.

### Info
For card payments, the digital receipt will display the last 3 or 4 digits of the card number. Standard register paper receipts show the last 4 digits of the EFT card number.

## Gift Receipts

### Scenario
When would a customer present a gift receipt?
A customer may present a digital gift receipt, which is sent via email or messaging from the Kmart application. The gift receipt includes transaction details and a scannable barcode.

### Confirming the price paid for the gift
Store staff need to validate the price paid by confirming the amount shown when scanning the receipt.

### Can a gift receipt be refunded?
No, gift receipts can only be used for exchanges or returning items to an exchange voucher.
