# Tips to Reduce eVoucher Washing

eVoucher washing occurs when an individual obtains an eVoucher in a transaction and later returns to the store to get a refund. They then attempt to receive the refund as cash, EFT, or back onto their credit card.

# How to Avoid eVoucher Washing

Check the receipt against the POS screen, which is the source of truth. Refunds should only be given in the same form as the original payment. For example, if the purchase was paid with an eVoucher, the refund must be issued as an eVoucher.

# Example

Scan the receipt for a refund request and verify that the transaction appears on the POS screen. Confirm that the receipt matches what is shown on the POS screen. If the customer requests a full refund and the original transaction was paid with $2 EFT and $78 via an eVoucher, refund $2 to the same EFT card and $78 onto an eVoucher.
