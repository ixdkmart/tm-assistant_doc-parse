# Push to Talk – Quick Tips

## Charging your Radio
Charge the battery before you start your shift. Ensure the battery has been charged, especially if it has a green light. Turn the P2T unit off prior to charging to prevent interference across the P2T fleet. Insert the P2T unit face down with the battery installed into the charging slot. Charging time is approximately 2.5 hours in a multi-unit charger from zero charge. If there are problems with charging, they may be due to dirty connections. Gently rub the silver connection points with an eraser to clean.

## Charger LED Indicator
The LED status indicates charging conditions. When charging, the LED is steady red. When the charge is complete, the LED is steady green. If the battery is faulty, the LED blinks red. Re-seating the battery pack will likely correct a fault indication.

## Care & Maintenance
Turn off the P2T unit when not in use to extend battery life. Charge over lunch breaks if needed. Use alcohol wipes only to clean the earpiece. Use a soft damp cloth to clean the exterior of the P2T unit. To avoid damage to the earpiece cord, ensure the cord is run inside the uniform of the wearer to prevent snags. Remove the earpiece when not in use and hang it on hooks set up in your store.

IT equipment management team responsibilities include when removing or attaching the earpiece, twist the P2T unit rather than the earpiece cable plug to prevent damage. Do not wrap the earpiece around the P2T unit or swing the unit by the earpiece. Press the main P2T unit button gently and in the center to avoid damage.

# Push to Talk – Troubleshooting Guide

## Individual P2T
If the P2T does not power on, place the battery in the charger. A flashing light indicates a battery fault. Log an incident (INC) and send the unit back (RTB). If the unit is not working, try cloning the settings to confirm the unit has not lost them. If it still does not work, log an INC and RTB. If the P2T keeps turning itself off, place it in the battery charger. A flashing light warrants logging INC and RTB. 

To test the earpiece mic button, use another device. If it works, no further action is needed. If it does not, log INC and RTB. For a sticking or unresponsive main button, log INC and RTB.

## When to order replacement P2T headsets
Log faulty headsets to be sent back and replaced via the RTB portal. Additional equipment can be requested by emailing kmrtrtb@kmart.com.au. RTB assistance depends on your store’s standard.

## Multiple P2T
If multiple units have crackling issues, tests can be performed with all units when they are not in use and time permits. Since the units operate on a one-to-many basis, a single cracking unit can cause all to sound crackly.

To identify the issue, recall all units to the office and turn them off before testing:
1) Test a loose connection with the earpiece by unscrewing and then re-screwing the earpiece into each device.
2) To isolate the faulty headset, turn on two units and test speaking between them. Set aside and turn off any units that crackle. Continue testing in pairs until two units work without crackling. Turn one off and test the remaining units with the known working unit. Log any faulty units as INC and RTB.
