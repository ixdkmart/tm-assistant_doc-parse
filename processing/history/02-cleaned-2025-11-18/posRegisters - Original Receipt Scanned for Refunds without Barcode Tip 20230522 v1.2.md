## Refunds Original Receipt Scanning Tip

How do I scan the original receipt if the customer has torn off the barcode?

The barcode number can be manually entered from the transaction detail at the top of the receipt.

The correct format to enter is:
27 [Store Number] [Register Number in two digits] [Transaction Number] [Check Digit]

Note: The check digit can be entered as any number.

Alternatively, the longer form of the barcode can be entered:

EXAMPLE | 012 | 1024 | 39 | 2958 | 141110 | 1643 | 715 | 000300

TEMPLATE | 012 | STORE | REGISTER | TRANSACTION | DATE (YYMMDD) | TIME (24hr clock) | OPERATOR | VALUE (max 6 digits)
