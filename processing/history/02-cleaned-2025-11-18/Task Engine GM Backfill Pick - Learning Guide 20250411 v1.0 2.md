## Task Engine main screen guide
Store number and today's date are displayed, for example, Kmart 1136 • Friday, 8 Dec. The initials of the logged-in user are shown, for example, AB.

The task type and world filter are available, with a filter button shown. The screen shows 4 of 24 tasks.

A task card displays the task description, fixture number, the most common world in this fixture, total keycodes scanned into this location, and the most common department. Example task cards include GM Backfill Pick for KIDS with fixture 7009 and 14 keycodes, and fixture 7012 with 37 keycodes.

To refresh the application if no tasks are shown, swipe or pull down. Task Engine fetches new data every 30 seconds.

## Completing a GM Backfill Pick task
To filter tasks by type, select the filter function. Choose to filter by Task Type to show only GM Backfill Pick tasks, or filter by World. Tasks displayed will then be for Kids World GM Backfill Pick.

Open a task to complete it by selecting the task card. Scan the fixture location barcode with the PDT or type in the fixture number using the keyboard icon. Once accepted, scan the barcode of the first item in the location, working from left to right, top to bottom.

The scanned product information includes the fixture location in progress, the "In Progress" tab showing recent scans, the "Take" number indicating the minimum quantity to pick (or 0 if no minimum), the locations where the product is scanned into, and a keyboard for manual entry if barcode scanning is not possible. If you are picking the last item of this keycode, ensure to scan it out of the fixture location.

After scanning, the "Take" number indicates the minimum quantity. If less is present, take all. Scan the barcode of the next item in the fixture location. If the "Take" number is 0, skip to the next item. If the product is in more than one location, enter the quantity picked from this location. Once all keycodes are scanned and quantities picked, press "Finalise Backfill". Ensure no keycodes have been missed before finalising. Your task is then complete and removed from the home screen. You can then select the next task.

## Troubleshooting
Refer to these steps for error messages:

For invalid fixture barcode, scan the correct fixture barcode matching the task. For barcode mismatch, ensure you scan the correct fixture and product barcode. If the fixture is already scanned, proceed by scanning a product keycode. If a product has been recalled or withdrawn, move it to the recall bag immediately; after removal, delete it from the fixture.

For errors like "Something went wrong" or "Lost connection," pull down to refresh, ensure you are within network range with Wi-Fi bars, then log out and back in. If the error persists, reboot the PDT or contact the IT Service Desk.

For lost connection with no tasks displayed, refresh the app, check network connectivity, and log out and back in. If unresolved, contact the IT Service Desk at:
