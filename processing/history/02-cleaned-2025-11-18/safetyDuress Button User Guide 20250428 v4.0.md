# Duress Button User Guide

A duress button, also known as a panic button or panic alarm button, is an electronic device designed to alert Kmart's security monitoring company, Chubb Security, in emergency situations where a threat to team members or property exists.

The duress button is located within the store's register area. Store leadership teams must ensure all team members know its location and the situations in which it should be used.

The duress button key must be placed onto a key ring and added to the key cabinet and key register. Do not leave the key in the duress button.

## Activating the Duress Button

1. The duress button is located around the register area of your store. Push both red buttons simultaneously if there is an emergency involving a threat to team members, customers, or property, such as a robbery.
2. Press the button after the offender has left the premises; do not press it during the incident to avoid creating a hostage situation.
3. Pushing only one of the buttons will not activate the alarm.
4. The alarm panel keypad will flash, indicating an input is in alarm; the alarm panel will not sound.
5. The indicator on the duress device will change from yellow to red to show that the input is activated.
6. An immediate duress alarm message will be sent to the security alarm company, Chubb.
7. Chubb will follow orders as set by Kmart and organize security and police attendance if applicable.
8. Chubb will ask for your store’s voice code, which is your store number.
9. Chubb will call the store to verify that the alarm has been activated.
10. If the duress button is pressed accidentally, the store must contact Chubb immediately to advise of the accidental activation.
11. If the button is pressed for an incident, it must be followed immediately by a call to triple zero to report the situation, the offenders' appearance, their direction when leaving, and if weapons were involved.

## Resetting the Duress Button

1. Locate the duress key and insert it into the duress button.
2. Rotate the key until the indicator changes from red back to yellow.
3. Reset the alarm via the keypad using an authorized code. The alarm indicator light will stop flashing.

## Testing the Duress Button

1. Testing must be conducted at the same time as your building alarm checks.
2. Contact Chubb to advise that you are conducting the test.
