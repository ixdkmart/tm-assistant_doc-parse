# Contaminant in product guide

## Objects in products

There may be instances where stores or customers identify foreign objects within or placed on products such as metal contaminants (e.g., blades, needles, clippers, etc.). Contaminants are typically identified either in store during decant or on the shop floor by team members, or by a customer after purchase.

Note: This process excludes syringes (used or unused). Dispose of syringes in-store using the sharps container found in the sharps disposal kit.

## Identified during Decant or On Selling Floor

When the product is identified during decant or while merchandised on the selling floor, stores must follow these procedures:

Finding contaminant:
During decant, any foreign objects such as blades, needles, clippers, etc., found by team members should be immediately passed to the decant facilitator. The decant facilitator must capture relevant product information (keycode, description, etc.) and take photos of the carton, product, and contaminant. The facilitator then passes the object and associated information, including photos, to a manager for reporting.

On the selling floor, any foreign objects in products found by customers or team members must be immediately reported to a manager. The manager should attend to the incident and:
If it involves a GM product, obtain details of the foreign object.
If it involves clothing, check if the needle or foreign object remains in the item.
If a syringe (used or unused) is identified, dispose of it in-store using the sharps container in the sharps disposal kit.
Wear appropriate safety equipment, such as safety gloves, when handling identified objects.
If a needle is found in apparel, check nearby products (on the same rack) for additional contamination. Ensure team members wear safety gloves during this check.
If multiple items are found with needles, indicating possible targeted contamination, escalate the incident immediately to the Compliance team and Zone Manager for further instructions.

Important: Be mindful of customer perception regarding foreign objects, especially needles, considering recent food incidents. Assure the customer that the incident will be reported immediately, and the contaminant and product (if apparel) will be sent for further investigation.

## Reporting identified contaminant

The manager must complete a hazard report in SolvSafety before the end of the shift, including relevant product information. A copy of the report should be printed and sent with the object. The object, if apparel or containing a needle, should be sent via internal mail to:
Customer Service,
Level 3, Mulgrave.
(Note: Syringes and sharps containers must not be sent to CSC.) For photos, email them to the customer service centre, including the incident report reference number.

Note: If an apparel item contains a needle, it is preferable to retain the actual product with the needle still in place to assist with investigation.

## Identified after purchase

When a customer reports finding a foreign object after purchase, stores must follow these steps:

If the customer returns to the store:
The manager should be contacted to assist the customer.
Obtain the object from the customer.
Collect relevant customer and product details.
The manager must complete a hazard report in SolvSafety before the end of the shift with all relevant information.

If the customer contacts the store:
Obtain pertinent details from the customer, including customer information, product details, and details of the object.
Request the customer to provide the actual object or any photos they have if the object is unavailable.
The manager should complete a hazard report in SolvSafety before the end of the shift, including relevant product information.

Important: Be mindful of customer perception regarding foreign objects, particularly needles, considering recent food incidents. Assure the customer that the incident will be reported immediately and the contaminant sent for investigation.

## Returning contaminant

Print a copy of the hazard report from SolvSafety and send it with the object. Send the object—such as a blade, needle, or clippers—and the report via internal mail to:
Customer Service,
Level 3,
Mulgrave.

Note: If a customer reports an incident directly to the CSC, the CSC will coordinate the return of the object with the store if necessary.
