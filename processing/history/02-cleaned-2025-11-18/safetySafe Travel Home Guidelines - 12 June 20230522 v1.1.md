# Safe Travel Home and After Dark Guidelines

Kmart takes seriously its obligations regarding the employment and the safety of its team members, including safe travel home from work and leaving their store after dark. All team members and managers are required to follow these guidelines. Additional requirements apply for team members under 15 years of age.

## For team members

Refer to the parking conditions for your store's location. If permitted by centre management, park close to the store entrance if parking is available. Never put yourself in harm's way. If you feel you are in a vulnerable situation, remain calm, try to remove yourself from danger, and contact a manager. Always arrive and leave via an approved entrance.

When leaving or arriving at the store during extended hours, ensure you are escorted to and from the building where possible. 

When leaving after dark, make sure a manager knows you are leaving and can access transport safely, including public transport. Walk in groups or with another team member if possible. Walk on pathways and stay in well-lit areas. Speak to your manager about the site procedure if you need to wait for transport after dark, such as waiting in the store until the transport arrives or having security escort you.

If you are under 15, ensure that a parent, guardian, or a person nominated by your parent or guardian drops you off and picks you up from an approved entrance. Check with your manager which entrances are approved for your store, such as the front of the store during trading hours or the team member entrance outside of hours. Ensure your parent, guardian, or nominated person remains with you until you enter the approved entrance. If they are delayed, stay with a manager until they arrive. If you are asked to stay back or change your working hours, always telephone your parent or guardian to confirm they are available to pick you up before accepting the change.

## For managers

Ensure all team members are aware of the approved entrances and the site procedures for arriving and leaving safely after hours or after dark. Encourage team members to follow the safe arrival and departure guidelines.

Ensure you meet the child employment legislation obligations for team members under 15 years old. Take all reasonable steps to ensure team members have arrangements for safe travel home after their shift. For example, ask if their parent, guardian, or nominated person is collecting them at the end of their shift. During a team member's shift, if changes to their hours are contemplated, first ensure that the team member has notified their parent or guardian to confirm they are available to pick them up or re-arrange transportation before proceeding with the change.
