## Messages for Store/Management team to deliver

Last year, Kmart and Khub stores lost one million dollars in PDTs. PDTs and other IT equipment are critical to store operations. Without enough devices, the store cannot complete critical processes such as picking and packing online orders, backfilling, and other inventory tasks. They also help serve customers in store and on the phone.

Team members should ensure they take care of Kmart IT equipment. This includes keeping devices on their person, using the Kmart PDT belt, and never leaving IT equipment unattended.

If a team member cannot find a device, they should report this to a manager as soon as possible. An action plan should be put in place to find the device.

Each shift, the device should be returned to the correct docking station and logged out. Devices should never be left in lockers or taken out of the store.

If a device is found unattended in the store, take the device to a manager as soon as possible. Devices should always be on a team member's person and not left unattended.

When a device is lost, the store must report this to the National Office and the Zone Manager. The store will have one less device to perform important tasks. The replacement cost of lost devices for FY24 will be deducted from the store's bonus pool.

Let's reset the store standards. Check throughout the store and ensure all PDTs, phones, and push-to-talk devices are returned to the charging stations.
