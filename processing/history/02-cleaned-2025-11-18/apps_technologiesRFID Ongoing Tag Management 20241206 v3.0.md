# Ongoing Tag Management
## Learning Guide

Having RFID tags on products allows Tory to count and locate stock.  
If there isn't a tag on the product, the item can't be counted or located.  
Being able to locate and count stock ensures better inventory accuracy (SOH) and makes it easier to find items for customers.

## Service desk process

Attach laminated A5 signage to a tote or container at the service desk.  
Service Desk team member to place any items requiring an RFID Kimble tag in this tote or container.  
AGPTS Manager to ensure these items are taken to the fitting room or tagged at the service desk, allowing sufficient time to process before the next Tory run.

## Fitting room process

Attach laminated A5 signage to a tote or container at the fitting room.  
All stock missing RFID and Kimble tags should be placed in this tote or container.  
Print and display the 'Missing RFID tags' poster at the fitting room.  
Before the end of each day, print and apply RFID tags and Kimble tags if required to each item, ready for Tory's next run.

Note: team members must have completed the relevant Digital Stores training to print RFID tags.
