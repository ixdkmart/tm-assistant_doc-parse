# Canvas Framing Instructions

1. Your canvas image must be larger than your stretcher bars by 3 inches in width and height. This allows the canvas to wrap around the edges and ensures the image is correctly centered. The Kmart printers are already set up for this.

2. Set out all materials neatly on the bench before starting. Ensure the surface area is clean. Remove the adhesive strip cover from all the bars, leaving the white adhesive strip on each bar.

3. Insert the bars into the red corner clamps so that the adhesive strip is facing up and towards the outside edge. There is a slot on the stretcher bar that must align with a 3cm cut tab on the corner clamp for proper positioning. If they are not aligned, the stretcher bar will not fit into the clamp.

4. Center the stretcher assembly over the flat canvas as shown. Make sure the stretcher bars land inside the material and that there is a little extra for trimming.

5. Push the bars that are opposite each other down so that the adhesive makes contact with the canvas. Repeat for the other sides.

6. Remove the corner red jigs by pulling up while holding the wooden bars down. Trim excess canvas material by running a blade firmly along each wooden bar. Ensure a neat and clean finish. Angle the cutter handle at 45 degrees as you cut. Gloves should be worn when using the cutter or blade.

7. Cut the corner from where the stretchers meet outwards at 45°. Be careful not to cut inside where the stretcher bars meet.

8. Fold the corners firmly onto the adhesive ends.

9. Run a small bead of IG wrap glue along the inside of the stretcher bars. Do not use too much glue, just a nice bead.

10. Bring the bars up to form the frame and insert staples firmly using red corner clamps to push staples into the wooden bars. Be firm so the staples sit flat into the wood.

11. Insert the corner braces into the groove on the inside of the stretcher frame. Gently push the braces towards the corners to increase tension. Repeat for all four corners.
