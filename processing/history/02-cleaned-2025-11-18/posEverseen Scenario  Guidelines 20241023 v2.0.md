# Everseen Scenario & Guidelines

# Product Switch Alert

## Product Switch Scenario
Review every intervention by checking the video, verifying that all items listed match what is in the bagging area carefully, and checking if the product has a stocker barcode over another barcode.

## 'Will Rescan' Everseen Intervention Scenarios

### Scenario: Customer is holding two boxes of chocolates
The customer scans one box and holds the other without scanning it. This triggers an intervention. Review the items scanned and the video. Only one box has been scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the second box of chocolates. Place it in the bagging area. The customer can then resume the transaction.

### Scenario: Customer attempts to scan an item that doesn’t scan
Review all items scanned and the video to identify the item not scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the missed item. The customer can then resume the transaction.

### Scenario: Customer is holding two of the same products
The customer scans one product but places both into the bagging area, triggering a no scan intervention. Review the items scanned and watch the video. Only one item has been scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the second item. The customer can then resume the transaction.

## 'No Rescan Required' Everseen Intervention Scenarios

### Scenario: Customer’s child waves around already scanned bottle
The customer scans a bottle. A child grabs the bottle and waves it around, triggering a no scan intervention. Review the scanned items and video. The item has been scanned. Select 'No Rescan Required'. The customer can now resume the transaction.

### Scenario: Customer leaves mobile phone on scanning bed
Review the scanned items and watch the video. All items have been scanned, and the system detects the customer’s phone as a no scan. Select 'No Rescan Required'. The customer can then resume the transaction.

### Scenario: Customer scans large container and moves lid
The customer scans the container, which also has a lid still in the staging area. The customer moves the lid after scanning.
