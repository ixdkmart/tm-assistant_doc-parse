# Inventory Management

## Gap Management: Completing a Gap Scan

### Why
Completing Gap Scans ensures. We maintain stock on hand (SOH) integrity. Out of stock (OOS) items are ordered or replenished so they are available for our customers.

### Who
Managers or authorised team members.

### When
Scan all empty labelled product locations at least once per week. This includes clearance, allocation, and advertised products.

### How
Find a PDT. Get access to a portable printer. Follow the steps below.

### Safety
Rotate hand or trigger finger regularly when using the PDT. Use a safety step when working above shoulder height or below waist height.

### Process
1. Access the management option from the main menu. Select a Gap Scan.
2. Ensure a printer is available. Select 'Y'. Then select the printer number.
3. Scan the shelf label on the next empty item location.
4. Confirm if the EDD date has been reached or has passed.
5. If a different screen appears, follow the steps in responding to other messages.
6. If further investigation is required, follow the steps in special process 1.
7. Enter 'Y' to confirm or 'N' to cancel the adjustment.
8. You will need one to cover each shelf edge label for the item.
9. Repeat steps 3 to 8 until all gaps have been scanned.
10. Enter 'Y' to print the backfill report now or 'N' to print later.

## Responding to Other Messages

Check the message shown on the PDT. Match it to one of the screens here and follow the steps.

Message: 'ITEM IN STOCKROOM'
Confirm if the empty item will be scanned into the stockroom. Count the number of units needed to fill the item. Use the numeric keypad with numbers 1-15. For example, "I'll need 15 units to fill this."

Message: 'ITEM AUTOMATICALLY FLAGGED FOR INVESTIGATION'
Items flagged for investigation cannot be adjusted without further review. Return to step 3 to continue.

Message: 'REMOVE LABEL'
Sometimes an item may no longer be ranged or sequenced. Remove the label to use the space for another item. The PDT will ask which location the label is being removed from. Scan the location label so the item is no longer associated with that side or end.

Message: 'INSERT OOS LABEL'
If the SOH value is already 0, insert an OOS label. Return to step 7. You will need one to cover each shelf edge label for the item.

## Special Processes
