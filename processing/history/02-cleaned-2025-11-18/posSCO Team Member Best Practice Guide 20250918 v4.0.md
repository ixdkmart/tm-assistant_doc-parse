SCO Team Member Best Practice

Standards, role requirements and responsibilities of the Self-Service Checkout (SCO) Team Member.

## Rostering Standards

When rostering for the SCO Team Member role, managers must ensure that two SCO Team Members are rostered for all core trading periods. To keep costs neutral, swap out one register operator for a SCO team leader.
Maintaining SCO Team Members is priority. Use register operators for other tasks if required.
Utilise team members for this role who are confident, engaging, approachable, and proactive. They should use a clear voice and hand gestures.
Ensure the SCO Team Member completes a warm-up as per the Warm-Up Poster prior to their shift and regularly walks around the SCO area to maintain stretching.
When a SCO Team Member is on a break, the replacement SCO Team Member must have completed the minimum training standards listed below.

## Minimum Training Standards

All team members rostered in the SCO Team Member role must have completed the following training:
They must complete the Kmart Way module in LMS.
They must complete the Self-Serve Checkouts module in LMS.
They must review the Quick Reference Guides for Everseen SCO Technology.
They must complete a demo on how Everseen operates on a SCO.
A SCO Team Member must read, understand, and comply with the No Apprehension Policy.
A SCO Team Member must read, understand, and comply with the 4Ds Poster.

## Equipment Standards

Every SCO Team Member must have the following equipment:
A blue vest.
Push 2 talk units (P2T).
A plastic sleeve with an operator barcode.
SCO keys.
A TC51 PDT to assist with product lookups.
A Kmart utility belt containing override reason code list, pens, checkseals, Profit Protection incident forms, and a portable EAS retractable de-tagger.

Ensure spare vests, tool belts, and push 2 talk units are available and stored within the central registers for seamless handover when shifts change, so each team member is ready to commence their shift on time.

## Setup Standards

The manager must have the roster available for service calls and a list of all rostered breaks for each team member.
Plastic bags should be stocked within the SCO area for customers to easily access.
Excess plastic bags and receipt rolls must be stored under manned registers for easy access.
Mark SCO Team Member 'return spots' on the floor.
Add wait lines to the top of the customer queue.
Hanger bins should be emptied and ready for use.

## SCO Operator Barcodes

Team members are responsible for their operator barcodes:
They can print their own operator barcodes at the start of each shift.
Barcodes must be kept in a plastic sleeve and on their person at all times.
If a barcode is lost, notify a manager immediately and password change.
At the end of each shift, dispose of the barcode into a secure bin.

## Role Requirements

SCO Team Members must have positive body language, be friendly, knowledgeable, assertive, and confident.
Positioning:
The first SCO Team Member should be highly experienced and act as the queue controller. They stand near the head of the queue and direct customers to available SCOs or registers.
The second SCO Team Member is the transaction assistant. They stand near the exit of the SCO and register area, assisting customers with transactions.
All threatening situations must be reported via the Safety Solvsafety portal.
Service standards must be adhered to at all times.
Any incidents from loss prevention should be reported to a manager who will submit an incident report.

## Customer Service Standards

The first SCO Team Member (Queue Control) greets each customer with a smile and a greeting as they approach the front of the queue.
They ask how the customer is paying (cash or card) and direct them to the next available SCO or checkout, stating "next checkout available."
They identify if a customer might need early intervention, such as carrying large or bulky products, and direct these customers to a manned register or use SCO assist mode.
They direct customers first to SCOs or offer a manned register if available, or if the customer refuses to use a SCO.
They communicate with the second SCO Team Member when SCOs become available to help with customer flow.
They keep the area tidy and safe by removing rubbish, empty hangers, etc.
They support the second SCO Team Member with interventions, ensuring product scans match the SCO POS screen.
They call for service support on manned registers when queues reach the first 'U' bend.
They assist with SCO Everseen interventions for no scans or product switches to ensure correct scanning.
They transact for customers wishing a manned register if one is unavailable.
They acknowledge customers waiting during multiple simultaneous red-light interventions by saying "I'll be with you shortly."
They farewell customers leaving the SCO or register area.
They apply checkseals to team member, visitor, or contractor goods.

If any of these customer service standards create a threatening or aggressive situation, always adhere to the 4D's and report the incident to a manager discreetly.

## Tasks Not to be Allocated to a SCO Team Member

SCO team members must perform only their role requirements and customer service tasks.
Under no circumstances should they be assigned:
Replenishment of SCO bags (to be completed by register operators during peak periods).
Empty hanger bins (to be completed by register operators or back of house team).
Central checkout replenishment of merchandise (to be completed by the sequence team).
