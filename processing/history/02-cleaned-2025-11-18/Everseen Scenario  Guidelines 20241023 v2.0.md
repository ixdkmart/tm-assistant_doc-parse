# Everseen Scenario & Guidelines

## Product Switch Alert

### Product Switch Scenario | SCO Team Member Required Actions | Products

These fragrance candles valued at $1.00 each have a sticker barcode.

Customers have been taking barcodes off these candles and placing them onto more expensive products to conduct product switches at SCOs.

Review every intervention by checking the video. Confirm all items listed match what is in the bagging area carefully. Verify if the product has a stocker barcode over another barcode.

### 'Will Rescan' Everseen Intervention Scenarios

Scenario | Action Required by the SCO Team Member

A customer is holding two boxes of chocolates. They scan one box and hold onto the other. They do not scan the second box, triggering an intervention while they are holding it. Review the items scanned and watch the video. You will see only one box of chocolates has been scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the second box of chocolates, placing it in the bagging area. The customer can then resume the transaction.

A customer attempts to scan an item that does not scan, triggering an intervention. Review all items scanned and watch the video to identify the item not scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' to ensure the missing item is scanned correctly. The customer can then resume the transaction.

A customer is holding two of the same products. They scan one but place both into the bagging area. A no scan intervention occurs. Review the items scanned and watch the video. You will see only one of the two items has been scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the second item. The customer can then resume the transaction.

### 'No Rescan Required' Everseen Intervention Scenarios

Scenario | Action Required

A customer is shopping with children and scans a bottle. One child grabs the scanned bottle and waves it around, triggering a no scan intervention. Review the items scanned and watch the video. You will see the item has been scanned. Select 'No Rescan Required'. The customer can then resume the transaction.

A customer leaves their mobile phone on the scanning bed. This triggers a no scan intervention. Review the items scanned and watch the video. All items have been scanned, and the system detects the customer’s phone as a no scan. Select 'No Rescan Required'. The customer can then resume the transaction.

A customer scans a large container and places it in the bagging area. The container has a lid still in the staging area. When the customer moves the lid after scanning, it triggers a no scan, as the system detects two products when it is one product with two pieces. Review the items scanned and watch the video. You will see all items have been scanned, and the system detects the container lid as a no scan. Select 'No Rescan Required'. The customer can then resume the transaction.
