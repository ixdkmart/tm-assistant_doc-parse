## The Facts

Customers submit their film orders at their local Kmart store. Only disposable cameras, film rolls, and negatives should be sent to the supplier. Re-usable cameras must not be sent, as they will not be returned. The store team will complete the film processing workbag with all relevant customer and order details. Orders are paid for at the time of submission.

Film orders are sent in a mailbag directly to Photo Create for processing via booking on the Australia Post Parcel Send website. Processed film orders are downloaded as digital files to the store's APEX system for printing.

## The Film Processing Offer

The service has been improved to a turnaround of 5-10 business days.

The service of sending negatives to the home has been removed. Negatives will be securely destroyed after film processing is complete.

A new service has been added to email digital images to customers, including all frames on the negatives. These digital scans will be stored for 60 days after processing before deletion.

Only 35mm film can be processed. Black and White, APS, or professional film cannot be processed.

## What You Will Need

Film workbags are used to take customer orders and include all required details. White courier bags with clear pockets, which are single-use only, are provided. Clear pockets are to be attached to the back of the courier bag, with the order log sheet folded and placed inside.

All film orders must be documented on the 35mm Film Order Log, a two-part docket comprising a store copy and a Photo Create copy.

Store record includes envelope number, surname, date, and phone number.

Customer record includes envelope number, a disclaimer about negative destruction and liability, and fields for surname, date, and phone number. Only one film should be placed in each bag. Instructions must be completed, folded back, sealed with tape, and the store record and log sheet must be filled out. Negatives are not returned unless explicitly requested, which is not offered.

The film processing services are listed with corresponding codes:

35mm processing options include different exposures with or without USB, and print options.

Save to USB and Rescans options are also listed, along with fees for blank film.

All orders are to be paid for in store at the time of drop-off.

Orders must be placed in white courier bags and sealed with the log book paperwork attached in the clear pocket. No negatives will be returned. If customers want negatives returned, do not process their order. All images will be sent electronically to stores.

Orders are completed by the Photo Centre team, who will ensure all details are filled out and give the top section of the workbag to the customer. Orders are documented on the 35mm Film Order Log, kept at the counter. The store copy is kept for proof; the Photo Create copy is checked upon receipt of the courier bag.

Completed film workbags are placed in white courier bags, which are for single use only. The back of the courier bag must have a clear plastic adhesive pocket, where two copies of the 35mm Film Order Log are placed: one to be kept by the store and the other to be sent with the order.

The courier bag is then taken to the back office and sent directly to Photo Create via Australia Post Parcel Send.

Photocreate develops the negatives and transfers the images into digital files without quality loss.

Film orders are visible in the store’s Kodak Apex Order Manager. Orders should be printed on the same day they are received and packed into a Print Wallet with the order label. The original workbag is not returned.

Uncollected printed orders must be kept for at least seven months. Staff must contact customers twice before disposal in the orange Shred-X locked bin, adhering to privacy laws.
