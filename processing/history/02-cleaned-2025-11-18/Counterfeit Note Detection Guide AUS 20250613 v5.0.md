# Counterfeit Note Detection Guide (AUS)

Counterfeit notes are an illegal imitation of currency. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud. This guide provides information on the security features of the two types of Australian notes to help identify if a note is genuine or counterfeit.

## If You Identify a Counterfeit Note

Contact your manager immediately. Do not handle the note. Report the incident to your Profit Protection Business Partner and email your state police. If the state police choose not to investigate, complete the AFP Suspect Banknote Submission Form and send it to the address listed on the form. Record the incident via Auror.

## Top Tips to Identify Counterfeit Notes

There are two types of Australian currency notes with slightly different security features: First Polymer Series Notes and New Polymer Series Notes. Follow these tips to identify a counterfeit note.

### First Polymer Series Notes

Check what it is made of. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner, and/or lighter than a genuine banknote. Scrunch the note in your hand. A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched. Feel the distinctive texture of the dark printing. The slightly raised print can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and numerals. Check the window to ensure the security features cannot be easily rubbed off. Hold the note to the light to view shadow images. When held up to the light, the Australian Coat of Arms should be visible under the print.

### New Polymer Series Notes

Check what it is made of. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner, and/or lighter than a genuine banknote. Scrunch the note in your hand. A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched. Feel the texture of the dark printing. The slightly raised print can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and numerals. Look at the small clear window for an embossed image with a light and dark effect. Tilt the banknote to see a 3D image with a colourful border that appears raised, observe a number changing direction within a building, and see colours change within a bird.

## List of Security Features - First Polymer Series Notes

Polymer substrate. The plastic gives them a distinctive feel. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner, and/or lighter. Most counterfeits are printed on paper and tear easily. Genuine notes return to shape after scrunching.

Clear window. The window should be an integral part of the banknote. Check that printed images in the window cannot be easily rubbed off. Look for embossing, such as a wave pattern in the $10 note window or value numerals in the $20, $50, and $100 notes. The $5 banknote does not have embossing in the window.

See-through registration device. Diamond-shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides of the note. When held up to the light, the patterns should align to form a seven-pointed star.

Shadow image. When held up to the light, the Australian Coat of Arms should be visible under the print, created by background variations.

Intaglio print. Raised dark printing can be felt by running a finger across portraits and major design elements.

Background print (offset). Fine-line patterns appear on each side of the note. They should be sharp, with no irregularities such as less-defined patterns, thicker or thinner lines, or color differences.

Microprinting. Tiny, clearly defined words are printed in the top left corner of the $5 note and near portraits on other denominations. Most microprinting includes the denomination in words or poems by AB 'Banjo' Paterson and Dame Mary Gilmore microprinted on the $10 note.
