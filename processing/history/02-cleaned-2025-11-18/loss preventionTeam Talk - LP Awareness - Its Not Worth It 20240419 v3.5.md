# Loss Prevention Team Talk

# Loss Prevention Awareness

Delivered by the store leadership team at the daily huddle.  
Delivered to all Kmart store team members.  
Team talk topic: LP awareness, reporting suspicious behaviour, and understanding the consequences.

Internal theft and fraud are on the rise at Kmart.  
There is an increase in investigations into theft of merchandise and cash, fraudulent transactions such as refunds and gift cards, and breaches in the code of conduct involving misuse of Flybuys and team member discounts.

Everyone must stay constantly aware and report any instances of suspicious activity.  
Understand the consequences of theft and fraud.

Look out for signs of suspicious behaviour.  
Products or parcels left in unusual locations.  
Empty packets, including in back of house areas.  
Witnessing a theft occurring.  
Leaving the store with stock that has not been paid for.  
Leaving a store without bags being checked.

Report suspicious behaviour.
