# Recall Notices

## What is it for?
Product Recall Notices are issued to ensure the safety of Kmart customers and team members. 

Once a product has been upgraded to Recall, a 'Store Communication' is added to KIT, and stores are notified of the communication. 

A public notice must be placed at the front of the store and in the area where the product is normally located.

Notices should be printed in the format they appear on KIT. They should not be scaled down or amended in any way.

Copies of the notices are also placed on the KIT site to ensure access at all times.

If the store copy is removed before the 'Remove on' date, it can be reprinted from the KIT site.

## Where do I find them?
Recall Notices are filed on KIT in the Resources section at Stores > Merchandise > Compliance > Current Product Recalls.

## What do they look like?
Recalls include notices with a red striped border and a triangle symbol. 

All notices for recalled merchandise must be displayed until the date specified.
