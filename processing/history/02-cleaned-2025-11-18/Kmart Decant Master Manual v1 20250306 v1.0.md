# Kmart Decant Master Manual

V1 - March 2025

# Introduction to Decant

Stock is delivered from our Distribution Centres to our stores on pallets or in foldable bins. They are unloaded from the truck, and this is where the decant process begins.

Decant is where all packaging and waste is removed from the cartons and foldable bins. The stock is micro sorted into categories ready to be filled to the shopfloor.

The Benefits of Decant

Removing cardboard, rubbish, waste, and trip hazards from the shopfloor. Improving speed to shelf with a 24-hour load turnaround. Enhancing productivity. Improving visibility of stock on H cages and Z rails. Improving H cage and Z rail sortation for load fill. Providing role clarity for the team.

# 5s Principles

5s is a set of five principles designed to improve organisation, cleanliness, and efficiency in the workplace.

The 5S process involves assessing everything in the space, removing unnecessary items, organizing everything logically, adding visual cues for the team, keeping the area clean, and ensuring these practices are always sustained.

Implementing these principles as part of your store culture will improve productivity, boost team morale, reduce costs, and enhance safety performance.

The 5S lean workplace principles:

Sort: Keep only what is necessary and discard everything else.

Set In Order: Arrange and label necessary items for easy use and return.

Shine: Keep everything swept and clean.

Standardise: Maintain the state established when the first three 5S are properly maintained.

Sustain: Make proper maintenance of procedures a habit.

## Waste

Waste refers to any activity or action that does not add value to the customer or the business.

In retail, waste can manifest as long wait times, inefficient or unnecessary processes, or actions that decrease productivity and complicate roles.

What is Waste?

D - Defects: Damaged stock that can't be sold or fails to meet expectations.

O - Over Production: Stock arriving early or produced more than required.

W - Waiting: Waiting for instructions, information, or equipment.

N - Non-Utilised Talent: Not utilising a person's skills, experience, or creativity.

T - Transportation: Unnecessary movement of equipment or stock.

I - Inventory: Excess stock in the stockroom taking up space.

M - Motion: Walking without a H cage, Z rail, or product.

E - Extra Processing: Individually pricing boxed product instead of changing the label.

# Safety

All team members and managers must follow safety principles to protect themselves from injuries and maintain a safe work environment.

All team members are to complete mandatory safety training modules.

Huddles and warm-ups are to be completed at the beginning of decant.

Correct PPE must be worn, including gloves, approved carton cutters, and safety boots.

Rotation of tasks or mini rest breaks should occur every 30 minutes.

H Cages must not exceed 1.5 metres in height.

Foldable bins should be accessible from both sides to prevent overreaching.

Two team members are required to lift and stack empty pallets. Four team members are required to lift and stack empty foldable bins.

Never lift, push, or drag empty pallets or foldable bins alone.

Floors must be swept during decant to prevent slips and trips.

Crates should be stored under the decant tables to prevent trip hazards and should be interlocked when stacked, not overfilled.

A facilitator must be in place to ensure all safety requirements are met.

# Our Learning Hub

In addition to mandatory safety training, two decant modules must be completed by all managers, facilitators, and team members working in decant.

These modules ensure the team has the knowledge and skills to perform tasks safely, efficiently, and to drive operational excellence.

# Warmups and Mini Rests

Warm-up exercises reduce the risk of musculoskeletal injuries and promote physical wellbeing.

Perform warm-ups before starting each decant by completing the prescribed exercises with six repetitions each.

Exercises include Motorbike, Twist & Shout, Good Morning, Huggy Bear, Head Tilt, Head & Shoulders, Spirit Fingers, Hula Hoop, Lateral Slide, Semi Squat, Macarena, and Liquorice Twist.

Scan QR codes for musical inspiration; aim for warm-up duration of 8-10 minutes, changing movements every 45 seconds.

Additional instructions: these exercises are mandatory at decant start, and can also be used as mini rests during shifts.

# Preparing Pallets for Decant

Writing time standards on pallets helps understand workload and optimizes placement when unloading from trucks.

Completing this can increase productivity by 15 cartons per hour.

Locate the carton count from the consolidation sticker.

Use the CPH calculator to find the time standard based on carton count.

Write the time standard clearly on the shrink wrap with a large, legible marker, facing the team.

Repeat for all pallets.

Note: NZ manifest consolidation info is obtained from the decant and sequence planning tool.

# Pallet Placement

During unloading, place pallets and foldable bins as shown to maximize decant productivity.

High carton count pallets should be at the front, with low carton ones behind.

Foldable bins should be in the front row for processing first, leading to a 20% productivity improvement.

# DC Manifest Carton Count Information

Access carton count info from the DC manifest screen in the application.

Locate the relevant manifest number; open the report via the excel icon.

Total cartons, categorized by departments (clothing, home, kids) are displayed, including total units and keycodes.

The manifest visualiser shows the total carton count and is also emailed to managers.

# Stockroom Zone Signage

Set up clear zones in the stockroom with signage for visibility and standards.

Zone 1: Pallets and foldable bins unloaded from trucks, ready for decant.

Zone 2: Micro sorted H cages and Z rails placed in department order for sequencing.

Zone 3: Overstock H cages and Z rails from load fill placed for pack away.

Micro sortation signage helps teams identify which H cages or Z rails to place on during decant.

Signage should be displayed either on walls or hung on H cages/Z rails, consistent across decants.

# Equipment Cage Signage

Signage indicating storage locations for equipment helps maintain safety and 5S standards.

All decant equipment must be stored in designated areas under relevant signage.

Decant equipment includes decant tables, crates, Z rails, H cages, H cage shelves, and safety steps.

Proper equipment use ensures effective and safe decanting.

# Decant Set Up Area

Set up the decant area as per the layout plan.

Lay out pallets, foldable bins, decant tables, cages, sorters, facilitator, and empty H cages and Z rails.

Assemble decant tables with bins and waste containers between tables.

Place crates underneath tables for micro sortation and store excess crates on cages.

Empty H cages and Z rails are lined up in the micro sortation area.

Ensure the decant area is set up before shift start.

# Huddle

Begin each decant with a manager-led huddle providing team updates, safety checks, and role assignments.

Huddle agenda includes warmups, PPE check, workload overview, role allocation, forecasted finish times, safety updates, and feedback.

Decant shifts are recommended to be 3 to 3.5 hours for optimal productivity.

# Decant Roles – Decanter & Sorter

Three roles are essential in each decant: decanter, sorter, and facilitator.

Decanters work from assigned tables, cut shrink wrap, unload cartons, remove waste, and fill crates, aiming for 90 cartons per hour.

Sorters work from assigned tables, micro sort stock into categories following signage, and stack H cages and crates correctly no higher than 1.5m.

# Decant Roles – Facilitator

The facilitator is a manager or responsible team member overseeing the process.

They do not perform decanting or sorting tasks but ensure procedures are followed.

Responsibilities include conducting the initial huddle, completing the Decant Take 5, rotating roles or implementing mini rests every 30 minutes, supporting team performance, validating micro sortation standards, and ensuring safety and order in the decant area.

After decant, they clear the area, reset equipment, and verify H cage and Z rail counts.

# After Decant

Maintain a clean, safe, and organized decant area after work.

Return equipment to designated locations.

Stack pallets no more than chest high with a team lift or 10 high with MHE.

Stack foldable bins no more than 4 high with a team lift or 10 high with MHE.

Recycle all cardboard and plastics appropriately.

Sweep the floor, removing all rubbish.

Limit storage on the shopfloor to a maximum of 2 H cages or Z rails per department ready for sequence.

# Decant Planning Tool

Use the planning tool to roster staff according to load workload based on the manifest.

Locate the manifest visualiser and copy the table.

Open the planning tool, enable content, save to desktop, and paste in the manifest visualiser data.

If multiple manifests are being decanted, enter each into their respective tabs.

Verify the manifest visually and connect to web content as needed for real-time updates.

# Completing the Decant Planning Tool

Input the manifest number, huddle time (10 min), FB2 additional, manifest cartons, start and finish times, and team size suggestions.

Set the decant team, including decanters, sorters, and facilitators. Adjust the number based on workload and team capacity.

Enter the cartons adjustment if additional processing is required.

Calculate the forecasted finish time based on input data.

# Decant Individual Time Standard and Feedback

Record each pallet or foldable bin time, along with total row time for sequence planning.

Facilitators to provide feedback during decant, monitor counts of micro sorted cages and rails, and record observations for improvement.

Ensure accuracy in these counts to support the sequence process.

# Decant Consolidation Data (NZ Only)

Use the consolidation section for effective pallet placement and understanding carton counts per pallet.

Tick off checked pallets, record the time standard, consolidation number, and department split.

Review full bulk pallet details and ensure data matches manifest info.

# Calculating Cartons Per Hour (CPH)

Locate the total carton count from the manifest.

Start a timer and cut the first carton at the same time as other decanters.

Stop the timer at the last carton.

Calculate CPH: total cartons divided by total hours decanting.

Example: 900 cartons over 10 hours with four decanters equals 90 CPH.

# Decant Health Checks

Regular self-health checks help maintain standards.

Assess decant performance with the following ratings: over 90% Green, 75-90% Amber, below 75% Red.

# Decant Timeline

Outline all tasks from load receipt to post-decant activities.

Receive load with time standards on pallets, placing high carton counts at the front.

Plan resources with the decant tool and set up the decant area before starting.

Conduct the huddle, check PPE, assign roles, and communicate workload.

Execute decant aiming for 90 CPH and a forecasted finish time, rotating tasks every 30 minutes.

Complete load validation, clear equipment, and conduct team feedback at shift end.

# Troubleshooting

If decant team is not achieving 90 CPH, recalculate, review principles, and ensure training completion.

If workload remains unfinished, analyze reasons, discuss improvements, and adjust carton counts accordingly.

If equipment runs out, review process and validate standards; ensure proper validation of crates, cages, and rails.

To manage the 2:1 ratio of decanters to sorters with the planning tool, assign the strongest decanter to one table with one sorter, the remaining team to another table, maintaining the ratio.
