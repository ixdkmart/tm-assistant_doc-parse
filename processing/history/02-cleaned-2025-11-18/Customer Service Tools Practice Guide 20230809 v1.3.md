# Customer Service Tools Practice Guide

## Purpose of this guide

Customer service tools help us provide efficient and timely service to our customers.

Team members should become familiar with these tools before using them on the job.

This guide allows team members to practice key tools with their line manager or buddy.

It also provides tips on how to use the tools effectively.

## How to complete this activity

The manager or buddy provides team members with a utility belt, Push to Talk (P2T) unit and earpiece, Portable Data Terminal (PDT), telephone with cordless handset, and a blank Customer Service Form.

Help team members learn these tools by guiding them through the recommended steps for each tool.

Ensure you have your own set of these tools available to assist.

Encourage questions and ensure team members are comfortable using the tools.

## Utility belt

The utility belt is designed for shop floor and stockroom team members.

It is used to carry tools and supplies needed for customer service functions and store presentation.

The belt contains internal phone numbers, white gloves, a customer service booklet, clear tape and dispenser, PDT, pen and marker, and alcohol wipes with plastic hook holder replacements.

To use the utility belt, note its contents and check before your shift that it contains all necessary items.

## Push to Talk (P2T)

The P2T is a small radio device with a wired earpiece used for communication with colleagues.

Before your shift, check the P2T works correctly.

It features an earpiece connector, smart status glow, volume control buttons, push to talk button, clip, microphone, and in some models, a touch screen display and push to talk app.

To use the P2T, compare the device with the diagram to understand its model.

Turn it on or off and return it to the charging cradle with the cord neatly wound at the end of your shift.

Connect the earpiece securely by screwing it in tightly and clean it with alcohol wipes before and after use.

Adjust the volume to hear clearly without it being overly loud.

Take care when moving equipment to avoid damage to the cord.

Practice talking and listening with a buddy, who should also have a P2T.

Use the device with the earpiece removed or muted during high focus tasks such as operating forklifts or balers.

Be alert for queries or assistance requests in the store area.

## Portable Data Terminal (PDT)

The PDT is used for scanning merchandise, checking stockroom locations, stock status, and accessing online resources.

It features a power button, scanner, touch screen display, store app, scan trigger, and online picking and packing app.

Log in with your employee number and date of birth as password initially.

Check that your login works before use and ask a manager to reset your password if needed.

Alternate hands or attach a trigger handle to avoid wrist injuries during long periods of scanning.

Assist customers by performing Item/Stock On Hand (SOH) inquiries.

Perform item searches for details when barcodes or keycodes are not available.

Use search by style and log out after completing tasks.

## Telephone

The telephone system enhances customer impressions and uses internal lines.

Stores typically have a cordless handset or desktop phone; some stores also use PDTs as phones.

In this activity, practice with a cordless handset.

Turn the handset on.

Greet the team member or customer call with the standard greeting.

Practice answering calls and placing calls on hold.

Transfer calls using the extension number of the recipient.

If the recipient does not answer, the call returns to your phone.

Make calls to managers or team members, and thank or farewell customers during calls.

Turn the handset off after use.

## Customer Service Form

The form collects customer and product details for various services.

It has a Store Copy and a Customer Copy.

Check the location of items that are 'on-hold' or being transferred at your store.

Fill in your name and the date.

Tick the relevant query boxes, such as hold, store-to-store transfer, pickup, delivery, layby, customer order, call back, or bike.

Complete customer name and contact details.

Fill in item information, including keycode, barcode, description, and quantity.

Repeat for the Customer Copy.

Record any comments and ensure the form is secured and not left unsecured with customer's details.
