# Everseen Frequently Asked Questions

## Benefits

What are the benefits of having Everseen SCO technology?  
As Everseen identifies instances where products are not scanned and prompts customers to scan items, there are several benefits including a reduction in shrink, increased sales, team member time savings, improved customer experience through providing customers with a method to self-correct in the first instance of a no scan, saving time in transactions and queuing, and the ability for Kmart to monitor the SCO area to identify operational efficiency opportunities.

## Cameras

What is captured by the cameras at a SCO?  
Only instances where no scans, basket base loss, and abandoned transactions occur are captured. These recordings are stored within the Everseen dashboard for 30 days. Footage of individuals' heads is pixelated for privacy reasons, and EFTPOS terminals are masked with a black box so PIN numbers cannot be shown.

What is the range of the cameras for Everseen? For example, will the cameras detect if a trolley is used, and items are not scanned?  
The Everseen technology only detects items on the SCO (side shelf, scanning bed, and bagging area). We are exploring added functionality for Everseen and what can be done to accommodate trolleys.

Is there anything that can impact the use of cameras?  
Yes. Cameras must always be kept clear for the system to work correctly. Decorations such as Christmas and Halloween should not be placed on or around the cameras.

## Customer Engagement

What needs to be considered with customer service and Everseen?  
Every customer must receive great service and should never be accused of wrongdoing. Missed scans can be accidental, and each case should be treated the same. Always follow the 5D's in threatening situations and notify your manager.

What has been the rate of CTS since Everseen went live?  
No CTS has been reported. The system has been trialed in the Chadstone store in VIC for over 12 months without any CTS instances. Monitoring continues.

If a customer questions the use of Everseen technology, what should I do?  
Team members should call a manager for assistance. Managers can direct the customer to signage at the front of the store and the SCO area. If privacy concerns are raised, customers can contact the Kmart and Target Privacy Manager (contact details on Everseen signage).

## Everseen Dashboard

What is the Everseen Dashboard?  
It is where all data collected for each store is stored. It records interventions such as no scans and reports on how those interventions are responded to, including team assistance. It also stores footage from interventions, allowing the Profit Protection team to monitor and review responses.

How do I get access to the Everseen dashboard?  
Currently, only the Profit Protection team has access. Store access will be provided in 2024, with training prior to access.

## Getting the Best Results from Everseen Technology

What do I need to do to get the best results from Everseen?  
The system will improve over time as the AI recognizes products scanned. Maintaining the SCO area and guiding customers to use it correctly is essential for performance. This includes collecting and removing products left at SCOs, ensuring no receipts, bags, or hangers are left, removing empty baskets, and preventing clutter.

How should I assist customers using the SCO incorrectly?  
If a customer uses the SCO backwards, assist them and guide them to place items on the correct side. Always assist customers asking about the technology and direct them to signage. When unsure, ask a manager for help.

What should I do if the Everseen technology is not working properly?  
Report the issue to your manager and log it through the IT Service Desk Portal.

## Help & Support

What should I do if I notice an issue with Everseen, like videos not showing or nudges not appearing?  
Contact the IT Service Desk. The team will coordinate with Everseen to resolve the issue. Any issues with Everseen or SCO equipment should be reported immediately to enable quick resolution.

## Media

Has Kmart prepared for any media releases?  
Yes. We have coordinated with the Corporate Affairs team during the setup of the Everseen project and are prepared to respond to media inquiries if needed.

## Other Retailers

How many retailers use Auror?  
Approximately 30,000 retailers use Auror globally. In Australia, 10 major retailers are using it.

Can Kmart see other retailer events and profiles?  
No. Kmart can only view events and profiles from within Kmart. Kmart does not share this information with other retailers. Changes to this policy will be communicated if they occur.

## Product Switch

If a customer attempts to buy a $30 pair of shoes but is barcode swapping with a $1.50 item, will an intervention still be recognized?  
Not yet. This feature, called product switch, is still under development and testing. Everseen and IT teams are working to improve it, with an aim to introduce it in early 2024.

## Reporting

Will we receive reports on Everseen results?  
Yes. One week after going live, you will receive an email with reports. These will include weekly no scan volumes, no scan value (based on an average cost of $5 per no scan), basket base loss, and abandoned transactions. A dashboard is being developed, and further access details will be provided.

How can we keep the team informed of Everseen results?  
Create a results poster from the report, print in color, laminate, and update it weekly using a whiteboard marker. The report is provided each Monday via email and is located on Kit > Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen.

## Signage

Do we need signage to inform customers about Everseen?  
Yes. Signage must be placed at store entry and the entrance to the SCO area. It should be located on Kit (Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen). The signage ensures compliance, and store audits will verify its presence and maintenance.

## Training

What training for Everseen is available?  
An LMS course and a guide are available on Kit (Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen). All managers and team members working at SCOs must complete these training resources.
