# Profit Protection Awareness

## Understand the consequences

Internal theft and fraud of any kind is a serious crime.

Profit Protection has systems and monitoring measures to identify internal theft and fraud.

The consequences may include termination of employment.

Legal consequences may involve police involvement, charges laid, and you may have to go to court.

Criminal convictions could impact future employment, restrict overseas travel, and affect the completion of studies.

There may be impacts to your colleagues, family, and friends.

You could be made to pay back what was stolen (restitution).

You could be banned from entering a Kmart store.
