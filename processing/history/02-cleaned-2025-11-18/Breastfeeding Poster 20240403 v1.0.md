# A message from Health, Safety & Wellbeing

## Breastfeeding welcome here
It is not just inclusion, it is the law.

## Our Vision
Where families come first for the lowest prices on everyday items.

## Did you know?
In Australian Federal Law, breastfeeding is a right, not a privilege. Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984, it is illegal in Australia to discriminate against a person either directly or indirectly on the grounds of breastfeeding. This means a woman has the right to breastfeed or express milk anywhere she chooses. This includes our stores.

Kmart is fully supportive of caregivers and is committed to gender equity for both customers and team members. This includes their right to breastfeed.

Kmart loves families and wants all customers to find Kmart a welcoming and safe place to shop.

## What to do
Seek help from your Store Manager if you are unsure.

No one should ever be asked by a team member to cover themselves or stop breastfeeding or expressing anywhere in our stores. This includes in fitting rooms or on the shop floor.

## What to do if you receive a complaint
Sometimes, other customers may take offence to seeing a mother breastfeeding or expressing in one of our stores. If you receive a complaint from a customer, you may advise them that this is a woman's right under Australian Federal Law. If you are uncomfortable, unsure, or if the complaint escalates, seek help from your Store Manager.
