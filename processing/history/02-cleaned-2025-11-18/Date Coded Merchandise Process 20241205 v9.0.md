# Managing Date Coded Merchandise

Date coded merchandise are products with a best before or use by date that indicates how long the product will be at its best flavor and/or quality. The differences between best before, used by, and expiry dates are:

Used By: The date indicates when the product may no longer be safe to consume or use.

Best Before: The date indicates when the quality of the product is at its best. The product can be consumed or used after this date; however, the quality might not be at its best.

Expiry Date: The date indicates when the product may no longer be safe to consume or use.

It is the responsibility of Kmart team members in each department with date coded merchandise to follow the dated goods process every day. This prevents date coded merchandise from being sold out-of-date, infested, and ensures profit is maintained.

Managers should ensure that the weekly date coded merchandise checks are completed via Auditor to confirm:

1. Date Coded Check – Week 1 for checkouts, cosmetics, personal care, and beauty.
2. Date Coded Check – Week 2 for share packs, boxed chocolates, baby products, and toys.
3. Date Coded Check – Week 3 for candy stations, confectionery, chips, auto, sporting, and camping.
4. Date Coded Check – Week 4 for Soda Stream, pets, home maintenance, SIM cards, and stockroom.

## Fill and Maintain Date-Coded Merchandise

### Step | Actions

1. Prior to filling date coded merchandise, print the latest list from the last page of this guide.
2. Refer to the date coded merchandise list at the end of this guide and check each product to ensure it is within date. Remove products within 4 weeks of the used by, best before, or expiry date and set aside.
3. When placing new products on shelves, position products with a longer lifespan at the back and the oldest at the front. Remove stock from shelf, peg, or basket if necessary to achieve this.
4. Always check products while filling for signs of opened packaging, pests, or damage. Refer to the 'Managing a Pest Infestation' section of this guide.
5. If overstocked, ensure overstocks with a longer lifespan are placed at the rear of the shelf and store excess stock in a cool, dark area in the stockroom.
6. For products within four weeks of their used by, best before, or expiry date, seek manager approval to markdown the price by 50%. If unsold after two weeks at this markdown, reduce the price further by an additional 50%. Excludes Lindt chocolates (refer to page 3).

# Managing Date Coded Merchandise That Has Passed Its Date

### Step | Actions

1. When a markdown product does not sell after the second markdown, remove the stock from the shop floor and back of house areas.
2. Mark the product as soiled or damaged using a PDT device under code 1.
3. Under no circumstances should products past their used by, best before, or expiry dates be given to team members or customers. Such products must be written off and disposed of appropriately.
4. Remove products from packaging and destroy them to prevent use or consumption. Dispose of in the dumpster.

## Managing Date Coded Merchandise in Back of House Areas

It is important to manage date coded merchandise in back of house areas to ensure it is sold before it becomes out of date.

Tips:
- Group date coded products into 2-3 areas for easier identification and management.
- When storing excess stock, place the oldest dated products at the front and the newest at the back.
- Regularly backfill date coded products onto the shop floor.
- If stock is nearing its out-of-date date and not selling, inform the manager for markdown action.

### Dated Goods Markdowns

Scenario | Markdown
--- | ---
Product is within 4 weeks of the used by, best before, or expiry date | 50% off the original price
Product has not sold after 2 weeks at 50% off | Mark it down a further 50%

Note: Drinks should only be marked down within 2 weeks of their used by, best before, or expiry date.

## Managing an Infestation in Date Coded Merchandise

### Step | Actions

1. Regularly check products on the shop floor and in the stockroom for signs of pest infestations such as mice or weevils.
2. Signs include damaged packaging, rodent droppings or urine, foul odors, evidence of nesting, scratching, or tracks.
3. If an infestation is identified, notify the manager immediately.
4. Remove all products from the affected area and clean thoroughly.

### Handling Infested or Mouldy Products

- Wear PPE such as gloves.
- Handle products in a well-lit and ventilated area to avoid inhaling mould spores.
- Avoid contact with eyes and skin.
- Clean areas where merchandise was placed.
- Dispose of products as instructed, and then dispose of PPE and wash hands thoroughly with soap and warm water.
- Log a request via Service Now for a facilities pest control contractor.
- Contact the relevant merchandise buyer for further instructions.
- Use write-off code 63 (Mouldy Stock) for infested stock.

## Dated Goods Rebate Process (Lindt Chocolate Only)

Out-of-date Lindt chocolates can be claimed through the supplier for a rebate. This requires approval from the merchandise team at National Office after completing these steps:

### Step | Actions

1. Identify Lindt chocolates due to be out of date within 14 days.
2. Remove chocolates from the floor and note the keycodes and quantities.
3. Email the buyer's assistant with the store name, number, keycodes, and quantities.
4. The buyer's assistant raises the claim and emails the store with instructions to adjust the stock off using code 52 (Out of date claimable by store) and dispose of the chocolates in the rubbish.
5. The chocolates are then officially raised in the IAS system, and the claim is processed by the rebates team.

Note: Do not adjust Lindt chocolates off under soiled and damaged, or the store will not receive a rebate.

## What If?

### Scenario | Actions

The date coded product's date has passed but it is a best before date. Can I share the product with the team? | No. Products with used by, best before, or expiry dates must be destroyed and cannot be shared with team members.

I have adjusted out-of-date Lindt chocolates under soiled and damaged. Will I get a rebate? | No. Rebate is only available if the product is adjusted under code 52.

Are there other products besides Lindt chocolates that can receive rebates? | No. Lindt chocolates are the only date coded product eligible for rebates from Kmart.
