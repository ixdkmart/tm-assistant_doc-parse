# Fitting Room Attendant Best Practice

## Standards, role requirements and responsibilities of the Fitting Room Attendant

### Rostering Standards
When rostering for the Fitting Room Attendant role, managers must ensure the Fitting Room Attendant completes a warm-up as per the Warm-Up's Poster prior to their shift and regularly walks around the fitting room area to maintain stretching. When a Fitting Room Attendant is on a break, the replacement must have completed the minimum training standards listed below.

### Minimum Training Standards
All team members rostered in the Fitting Room Attendant role must have completed the Fitting Room module in LMS prior to being rostered. They must also complete the Bag check module in LMS before their shift. They must have completed the Safe Work Practice module for trolleys, working at heights, scanning equipment, needle and pricing guns, and merchandising. The Fitting Room Attendant must read, understand, and comply with the Managing Threatening Situations – 4Ds Poster.

### Equipment Standards
Every Fitting Room Attendant must have the following equipment: an anti-fatigue mat; push to talk units (P2T); a PDT device if available or an EC30; a Kmart utility belt containing a pen, customer service forms, LP incident reporting forms; coloured number tags; a rubbish bin; spare plastic hangers; keys to lock fitting rooms if the Fitting Room Attendant needs to leave the area unattended; cleaning equipment (gloves, cleaning spray, wipes, tissues); Kimble tags and needle gun; a pricing gun; an RFID printer to reprint barcodes; and a safety step and mirror to check areas high up such as the tops of large mirrors.

### Setup Standards
Spare plastic hangers of various sizes should be available to hang apparel returns. Clothing rails should be cleared of all returns from the previous day. Number tags should be available. Anti-fatigue mats should be positioned behind the fitting room counter. The storage area should be cleared to hold non-apparel stock for customers when they enter a fitting room.

## Role Requirements
A Fitting Room Attendant must have positive body language, be friendly, knowledgeable, assertive, and confident. The fitting room should be positioned behind the counter at the entrance. All threatening situations must be reported via the Safety Solvsafety portal. Service standards must be adhered to at all times. Any incident from loss prevention should be reported to a manager for an incident report.

## Customer Service Standards

### Customers Entering the Fitting Room
Greet each customer as they approach the fitting room counter. Check the number of apparel items the customer wants to take into a fitting room and provide a number tag to identify how many items have been taken in. Request to take any non-apparel items from the customer and place them in a holding area, which are returned when they exit. Conduct bag checks on all bags of A4 size and larger, prams, trolleys, cartons, etc. If Kmart items are found, offer to hold the items while the customer tries on apparel items.

If a customer asks to leave their trolley, bag, or children with you, advise them that you cannot take responsibility for the items or children. Inform them that you may be called away at any time and Kmart cannot take responsibility. Offer the disabled fitting room that has more space for children if needed.

### In-Between Service
Hang and fold apparel items so they are ready for the shop floor. Check fitting rooms regularly to ensure they are clean, tidy, and free from apparel, hangers, and packing left behind. If syringes are found, call a manager immediately for safe disposal. Check for empty packets and place them into empty packet bins. Damaged garments should be set aside and given to the manager for markdown or disposal. Replace tags on garments when missing or fallen off.

### NZ Stores Only
If a customer approaches to collect a click and collect order and there is no second team member at the fitting room desk, the Fitting Room Attendant must request assistance to prevent the desk area from being left unattended.

### Customers Exiting the Fitting Room
Greet customers upon exit and ask, "How did you go?" Check that the number of apparel items in their hand matches the colored number tag. If fewer items are returned than the tag indicates, ask the customer to return to the fitting room to bring back the additional items. Once the customer leaves, inform a manager. Offer to take any apparel items the customer does not want to purchase. Return non-apparel items on hold to the customer. Report any lost property left behind to a manager.

If any of these customer service standards create a threatening or aggressive situation, always adhere to the 5D’s and threatening situation protocols. Report the incident discreetly to a manager.

## Tasks Not to be Allocated to a Fitting Room Attendant
Fitting Room Attendants are to complete their role requirements and customer service only. Under no circumstances should they be allocated tasks such as applying merchandise protection equipment to products, escorting customers within the store, or click and collect pickup.

## What Good Looks Like
Fitting rooms must always be presentable and ready. Keep each fitting room clean using cleaning equipment. Ensure mirrors, benches, seats, and floors are always clean. Fold or hang back apparel left behind onto the return rack. Collect and hang spare hangers at the fitting room bench area. Collect and dispose of rubbish into the bin. Collect empty packets and place in the empty packet bins. Recover lost property and report it to a manager.
