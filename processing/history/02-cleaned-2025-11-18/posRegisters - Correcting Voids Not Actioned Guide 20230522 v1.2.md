# Correcting Voids Not Actioned

## What is this for?
Register errors can occur when a transaction has not been correctly voided using the 'Total 10 Non Sale' function.  
Void slips must state 'Operation Complete' to be considered successfully voided.  

If you identify a register error caused by a void not being actioned, it must be corrected.  
This applies to both sales and refunds that have not been successfully voided when required.  

EFT transactions and lay-by payments cannot be corrected in this manner.  

## Correcting refunds that have not been voided
Create a sale for the same items, with the same price and cash, as shown on the register receipt or escape printout on the same register where the original error occurred.  
This will correct the stock on hand for the items and create a compensating shortage for the error reported due to the void not being actioned.  

## Correcting sales that have not been voided
Create a refund for the same items, with the same price and cash, as shown on the register receipt or escape printout.  
This will correct the stock on hand for the items and create a compensating overage for the error reported due to the void not being actioned.  
Do not process the refund at the Service Desk registers.  
The refund should be completed on the register where the original error occurred.  

## Documenting refunds
Attach all refund documentation, including any voided e-vouchers, to the K162 slip with details entered in the applicable section (for refunds on non-refund registers).  
Transactions require an authorising signature.  
Register Readings Book / Reconciliation tab in the cash machine spreadsheet investigation details should reference the work week (W/E) that the original error occurred.  

## EFTPOS Transactions
If a customer was charged twice on their EFTPOS account, record the information in the Register Readings Book / Reconciliation tab in the cash machine spreadsheet.  
The customer will most likely return to the store for a credit or refund on one of the transactions.  
If a customer was given a refund twice on their EFTPOS account, record the investigation information in the same spreadsheet.  

## Lay-by Transactions
Refer to the Lay-by Department section of the Register Operations Manual for details on voiding lay-by payments.
