Digital Stores roadmap

Key elements along the roadmap are RFID Khubs, Backfill Optimisation, Demand driven GM backfill, Inventory Accuracy 2.1, Apparel Markdown, Digitised Replen, Product location maps, Task Engine, Kmart NZ Apparel RFID, and Kmart AU Apparel RFID.

The roadmap shows a progression of digital store initiatives, with checkmarks indicating completed items. The elements are arranged along a curved road visual, suggesting a strategic pathway for implementation.

Agile delivery

Traditional delivery:
Solution scoped, designed and developed, followed by a full launch.

Agile delivery:
Incremental progress with steps including solution scoping, proof of concept, pilot, extended pilot, and full launch, with user feedback incorporated at each step.

Key benefits include early access to the tool, early and frequent feedback opportunities, influence over next functionalities, and improved team satisfaction and productivity.

What do agile enhancements look like for stores?

Updated route planning, Table clustering v1, Pathfinder barcode scanning, single pick reduction, customised store-specific MDU's, wall bleed reduction, identification of recalls or withdrawals, near-time reporting, sound alerts for clearance or no sales in 30 days.

Why are we changing?

We have an inconsistent approach to backfill completion across stores, with a huge opportunity to reduce waste.

Focus on 100% completion of all fixtures each week.  
Order is based on store team's preference with minimal data backing decisions.  
Fixture pick timing impacts volume coming out.  
Congestion in BOD affects other store processes.  
Maintain or improve sales using data-driven prioritization (right fixture, right time).

Benefits

EBIT REM BENEFIT  
$2.53m  
Seven hours saved (-26%) on average per store per week on backfill task.

SALES BENEFIT  
$12m  
1.75% sales increase, tracking performance of BOH keycodes.

Fixtures picked:
On average 30% fewer BOH fixtures scanned per week.

Units picked:
On average 25% more compared to pre-pilot stores completing 100% backfill.

Volume:
9.5% more cages driven to the shop floor.

Repeat locations:
Fixtures repeated during peak periods: 6.8, and during standard weeks: 1.9.

How value is unlocked

Fixtures prioritised by logic – right stock, right time.  
Increased volume from stockrooms.  
Decrease in BOH congestion.  
Non-value fixtures removed from workload.  
Less fixtures scanned weekly.  
Productivity in backfill pick and sequence packing increases.  
New logic saves managers time choosing fixtures.

# Page 9

Demand Driven Backfill

Daily fixture prioritisation removes non-value fixtures using dynamic logic to determine the percentage of total locations to pick each week.

Key elements:
Prioritise the most valuable fixtures based on right stock, right time.  
Pick the maximum stock productively.  
Identify fixtures to repeat weekly to maximise stock availability and sales.  
Average completion of 70% of total fixtures, saving REM and driving sales.

# Page 10

How will backfill change?

Prioritisation and thresholds are introduced.  
Fixtures are provided daily via task engine on PDT.  
Stores will only complete fixtures if value is identified.  
Stores are required to complete 100% of fixtures generated each day.  
There is no need to complete 100% of total stockroom fixtures.  
Compliance is measured daily by fixtures generated versus completed.  
Additional fixtures cannot be added.  
Reporting will be in Power BI, replacing paper-based reporting long term.  
Near time reporting will be available soon in the Manager Portal.

# Page 11

What's not changing?

No change to how take quantities are calculated.  
Scanning all keycodes in fixtures remains the same process.  
Manifesting on time impacts required take quantities.  
SMS is calculated based on scanned versus expected.  
Scanning overstocks resets keycode take quantities to zero.  
Fixtures numbered 8900–8999 won't generate backfill tasks.

# Page 12

Introduction of prioritisation logic and thresholds

Current state:
All fixtures picked on Monday.

Future state example:
Fixtures scheduled across the week on different days, targeting the right locations at the right time.

This maximises stock volume coming out and improves stock availability on the floor.  
Non-value fixtures not required to backfill for that week are marked as N/A.

# Page 13

Non-priority fixtures

Week 1-4: Fixture 8003 not done, marked with a red X.  
Week 5: Fixture 8003 added to priority list regardless of previous status.

Key information:
All fixtures are backfilled over a rolling five-week period.  
Less than 5% of fixtures are expected to reach week 5.  
Fixtures not scanned within 28 days are automatically added to week 5 to maintain SMS integrity.

# Page 14

Repeat fixtures

Fixtures may be completed, monitored, or added to the priority list for the following day, based on their score and completion status.

# Page 15

Workload planning

After three weeks, a baseline trend of daily fixtures will be identified to create a new roster.  
Weekly fixture counts are available every Monday via the Power BI report.  
The daily task list is reviewed, and team members are allocated fixtures, with options to filter by world.  
Uncompleted tasks are recalculated and reprioritized for the next day.  
Repeat fixtures may be added daily, including weekends.  
If weekly tasks are not completed, additional fixtures will be generated the following week.

Prescribed fixtures must be completed Monday to Sunday, with 20% assigned each weekday.

# Page 16

Backfill task completion

All GM backfill tasks are created daily between 4.00am and 5.00am local time.  
Fixtures are provided via task engine on PDT.  
Each fixture has its own task card; team members select tasks using the GM backfill pick filter.  
Only prescribed fixtures can be completed; additional fixtures cannot be added.  
Stores will only complete the same fixture if value is identified.  
Location refresh adds value to fixtures the following day.  
Backfill functions for shop floor and stockroom scans remain available.  
Current backfill functions will be disabled.

# Page 17

Task compliance

Compliance is measured daily as the ratio of fixtures generated versus completed.  
Stores are required to complete 100% of generated fixtures each day.

For example, a store generating 20 fixtures daily must complete all 20.  
Compliance percentages vary daily but total at 80.6% over the week, with some days below 100%.

Weekend compliance and completion are required during the pilot.

# Page 18

Reporting

Power BI reporting is available.  
Paper-based reporting is being phased out.

Dashboard components include performance metrics, SMS integrity, and progress reports.  
"Coming Soon" labels indicate upcoming features.

# Page 19

When priority logic works best

Stockroom keycodes should be scanned in correctly, increasing fixture priority.  
BOH fixture sortation should be tidy to facilitate scanning and drive SMS integrity.  
Multi-located keycodes should be kept below 5%.  
Location refresh maintains fixture accuracy and stock flow.  
Gap scans should be completed as per store task system.

# Page 20

Getting ready

Complete lean (5S) reset, location refresh, and gap scans as part of BAU.  
Backfill should be completed 100% by the Friday before going live.  
Multi-location actions should be under 5%.  
Team members should be rostered and trained.
