# Safety Footwear Allocation Process

## Guiding Principles
This process applies to all Kmart Team Members completing tasks outlined in the PPE matrix that require safety footwear. Team Members are only entitled to one pair of safety footwear per year through the allocation options or reimbursements.

## PPE Documents
The FAQ - New PPE Matrices is located under Stores > Health & Safety > Policies Procedures & Standards > Guidelines.
The Approved PPE Matrix for Stores Selling Floor is found in Stores > Health & Safety > Policies Procedures & Standards > Procedures & Standards.
The Approved PPE Matrix for Stores BOH/Stockroom is available in Stores > Health & Safety > Forms Posters & Resources > Forms and Registers.

## Footwear Allocation Options
Safety footwear can be allocated to Kmart team members through the following options. Each option requires completing the Safety Footwear Allocation Form via Kit (Stores > People > Teamwear & Team App).

Order options include:
Kmart stock: footwear must meet the PPE matrix standard, allocated from store stock up to $80, recorded on the form with all fields filled including adjustment information, and adjustments processed on the PDT under Store Staff Uniforms (code 31). The quantity should be entered as positive in PDT.

Stock adjustments are made via Stores > Loss Prevention > Procedures > Other.

Ordering footwear for Australian stores is done through Workwear Group. It is recorded on the Safety Footwear Allocation Form, with adjustment fields not required.

Online ordering is available in Stores > Operations > Online > Standards, using the Safety Footwear Ordering Guide located in Stores > Health & Safety > Forms Posters & Resources > Resources.

Ordering footwear for New Zealand stores is done through Blackwoods NZ using the normal store login. Record it on the Safety Footwear Allocation Form without adjustment fields.

## Petty Cash Reimbursement
For Australian stores, reimburse up to $80 through petty cash (SCTF) if other options are unsuitable. Record on the safety footwear allocation form. Reimbursement is done through the petty cash process, and a receipt should be attached. If the purchase exceeds $80, reimbursement is limited to $80. Adjust the GTS calculation accordingly. Footwear must meet the PPE matrix standards.

For New Zealand stores, reimburse up to $120 every 2 years through petty cash. Record on the safety footwear allocation form, send the reimbursement form and receipt to Kmart Store Payroll. The footwear must meet PPE standards.

## Safety Footwear Allocation Form Process
Step 1: Save a copy of the Safety Footwear Allocation Form from Kit (Stores > People > Teamwear & Team App).  
Step 2: Complete store details at the top of the form.  
Step 3: If footwear is Kmart stock, fill out all fields, including keycode and adjustment info, and ensure it is adjusted under 'Stores Staff Uniforms' on the PDT (code 31) the day it is issued.  
Step 4: For footwear ordered from suppliers or reimbursements, adjustment info is not required.  
Step 5: If a team member takes footwear home without wearing it on the day of issue, attach a check seal to the footwear or bag.  
Step 6: Set up a tab labeled 'Safety Footwear Allocation' in the back office filing system.  
Step 7: Place all allocated items in this tab.  
Step 8: Retain forms to track footwear allocated to team members within the year.

## Safety Footwear Returns/Exchange
Use the Safety Footwear Returns & Exchange Form to return footwear if not fit for purpose or faulty, only if adjusted through Stores Staff Uniforms (code 31). Make an adjustment of +1 on the PDT to add stock back to stock on hand. The form has sections for returned items and exchanged items with details including date, keycode, description, stock adjustment quantity, team member, and manager.

Step 1: Team member returns footwear to manager.  
Step 2: Manager holds returned item while the team member selects a new item.  
Step 3: Manager retrieves a blank Safety Footwear Returns Form from the Back Office filing system.  
Step 4: Manager fills out the form and places it back in the system to be processed the following Friday.  
Step 5: Place the returned item back on the selling floor if fit for resale or into the RLO area if faulty.  
Step 6: Set up a tab labeled 'Safety Footwear Allocation' in the back office filing system.  
Step 7: Store all returned or exchanged items in this tab.

## What If Scenarios
A team member who has already been issued one pair of safety footwear within the current financial year requires more. They can purchase additional footwear using the team wear purchasing option.

To check if safety footwear allocations were processed correctly, search the shrinkage report for adjustment code 31 under Stock Management.

Team members must wear their safety footwear when performing tasks that require it, as per the PPE matrix. They are not entitled to a new pair if they forget their allocated footwear.

If footwear is worn out or unsafe, it must be replaced according to the PPE matrix.

Team members should refer to the Stores Teamwear Policy for information on uniform standards, accessible in Kit under Stores > Policies > Human Resources.

The adjustment code 31 for Stores Staff Uniforms is only used for footwear outlined in this guide and the stores teamwear policy.
