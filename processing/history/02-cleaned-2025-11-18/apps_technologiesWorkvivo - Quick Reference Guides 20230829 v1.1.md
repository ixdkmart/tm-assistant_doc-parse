# Space Owners and Administrators

Spaces are communities within Workvivo centered around specific topics such as Health & Wellbeing, Life at Kmart, Pride, and First Nations. Store and Distribution Centre have dedicated Spaces managed by Store and DC Managers with leadership support.

As a Space Owner or Administrator, you agree to:

Manage Space access as new team members will be added via Active Directory and promote others to Space Administrator roles when needed.  
Appoint a Moderator for content moderation.  
Post regular, varied content including updates, news, and good news stories through events, articles, posts, and documents.  
Periodic review of the Space description to ensure alignment with your space vision (not required for Store or DC Spaces).  
Review Space analytics such as visitor numbers and top contributors to guide future content.  
Plan a content calendar monthly.

# Top tips for building your Space

Utilise polls, shout-outs, and calls to action to encourage engagement.  
Pin important content to the top temporarily.  
Post featured updates with high-quality images.  
Invite interested team members to join (automated for Store and DC Spaces).  
Seek regular feedback on shared content.  
Promote collaboration and sharing by tagging team members in posts and comments.

# How to create engaging content

Create quick, inspiring content with these tips.  
Use supported content types: general posts or updates with images or videos, values updates tied to Kinetic values, Kudos, event promotions, and polls.  
Post about resources, news, questions, customer stories, team member profiles, events, interviews, project updates, competitions, or feedback prompts.

Our tone of voice emphasizes energy, inspiration, engagement, and empowerment.  
Be energetic, motivating, fun, and inclusive.

# How to take great photos, selfies, and videos

Ensure your lens is clean. Use good lighting, preferring natural light. Keep shots steady with both hands or a stabiliser. Use clear audio by recording in quiet environments and close to the source. Consider using an external microphone. Edit with filters cautiously, keeping content authentic.  
Capture candid shots for genuine content.

Before posting, review your message for accuracy, spelling, and tone. Ensure it complies with policies. Attach images, include calls to action, tag relevant people, post in correct Spaces, choose optimal posting times, and monitor responses.
