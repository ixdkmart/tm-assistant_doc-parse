# Tips to Reduce Refund Fraud

With refund fraud on the rise, it is important to ensure the policy and processes are followed exactly.

## Tip 1: Communications between Customer Greeter and Service Desk Team
As customers enter the store, identify those visiting for a refund and determine what they are returning. Communicate this information to the Service Desk via 2T. Advise the customer to keep receipts for refunds.

## Tip 2: Refunds must be paid to the same tender as the original purchase
Scan the receipt at POS to confirm the original tender payment type. For card payments, match the last four digits of the card on the receipt to the physical or digital wallet card. If the customer does not have the original card, refer to the refund policy or call a manager for assistance.

## Tip 3: eVoucher Washing
To prevent eVoucher washing, always refund back the same way the transaction was paid. If a payment was made with an eVoucher, then the refund must be provided as an eVoucher. Always check the POS screen against the receipt to validate.

## Tip 4: Refund request, but the receipt won't scan
If the refund is over $100, search in POS for the original receipt or ask a manager for assistance to identify the transaction.

## Tip 5: Refund Authorisation
Refunds over $250 must be reviewed and authorised by a manager. The manager must be present to authorise and scan their barcode.
