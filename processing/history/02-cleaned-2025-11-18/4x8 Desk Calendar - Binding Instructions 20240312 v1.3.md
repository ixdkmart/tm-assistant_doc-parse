# Instructions for Making 4x8" Desk Calendar

## What you will need
You will need monthly 4x8" calendar prints produced on the D4600 duplex printer. You will also need a 4x8" calendar kit, which includes a cardboard black frame, an acrylic cover, and black binding wire.

## Step 1
Fold the black cardboard frame on the centre score line.

## Step 2
Pull out pins 1, 2, 25, and 26. Using the 23 pins not pulled out in between on the calendar binding unit, centre the black cardboard frame and punch holes through both ends of the cardboard frame. Be very firm with the handle to ensure the best result.

## Step 3
Repeat the same for the acrylic cover and calendar pages. Punch four pages at a time for best results, ensuring the pages are not mixed out of place.

## Step 4
Place the calendar prints on top of the folded black cardboard frame, followed by the acrylic cover on top.

## Step 5
Thread the black binding wire through the frame, prints, and cover. Clamp the calendar wire shut by inserting it at the back of the calendar press machine and pulling the handle firmly to close the wire coil. Do this slowly to ensure the best result.
