# Managing Foreign Insect and Species Guide

# A KMART GROUP STORE & DISTRIBUTION CENTRE REFERENCE GUIDE

# 2024

# Introduction

## Who should use this Guide?

This Guide is for all Kmart and Target Store and Distribution Centre team members. It explains how to manage confirmed or suspected foreign insects or species found in products. It includes containers that have traveled from overseas. It outlines regulatory requirements for addressing such cases.

## Background – What is the risk to the business and environment?

Foreign insects and other species, including borers, can threaten agriculture export industries, the environment, native flora and fauna, and tourism. 

When a business area, like a DC, store, or National Office, detects a foreign insect infestation or species contamination in a product or shipping container, it must be managed carefully. This ensures environmental protection and compliance with laws governed by the Department of Water and Environment (DAWE) in Australia or Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) in New Zealand. Non-compliance can lead to penalties and reputational damage.

Contamination may appear as a live or dead insect or a larger species such as a reptile or rodent. Evidence may include sightings or signs like borer activity. Examples include images showing tracks, activity, borer holes, or frass (wood dust). Borer activity often reveals grains of wood, with filler appearing as grey or white dust.

# Actions

## When a foreign insect or species contamination is identified

If a store or DC detects or is alerted to potential contamination, these steps must be taken:

### Team Member Actions

If a team member notices a suspected foreign insect or species or evidence of such in a product or packaging, they must remove affected products from the area without disposing of them. Take clear images of the evidence. Document the affected keycodes and batch codes.

Seal the products in double plastic bags or shrink wrap to make the evidence airtight. If safety is a concern, wear gloves and a mask when handling contaminated products. 

Isolate the affected products at least 1.5 meters from other products, preferably at the back of the store, to prevent cross-contamination, especially in cases of borer infestation.

Label the sealed products as "contaminated" or "borer", including the number of products and batch codes, using the labels provided at the end of the document.

Inspect other products of the same keycode for signs of infestation. Remove them from the shop floor even if no signs are present.

Count each batch code and secure the evidence separately from the initial contaminated products, sealing in airtight bags or wrap.

If a foreign species, such as an insect or animal, is found outside a product, contain it safely. Do not put yourself or others at risk. Cover live animals with a solid container or capture without harm if safe to do so.

Contact the National Office by email at regulatory.affairs@kmart.com.au and the Customer Service Centre at CustomerServiceCentreKmart@kmart.com.au. Follow instructions provided by the National Office.

### Customer Return of Samples

If a customer returns a product with suspected foreign species:

Request the customer to take images of the evidence and double bag the product securely. 

If the product is returned unbagged, double bag immediately and label as "contaminated" or "borer," then isolate the product at least 1.5 meters from other products, preferably at the back of the store.

Process the return normally.

Notify the National Office via email as above and wait for further instructions.

### Important Notes

Do not dispose of the product, as it may be required for investigation by authorities.

# Regulator and Media Contacts

Sometimes a regulator (state-based, DAWE, or MPI in New Zealand) contacts the store or DC. Follow the Regulator Contact Guidelines for store, National Office, and DC.

Media inquiries may arise. Obtain customer details if possible, so the customer service team can follow up and collect samples. If the inquiry comes through channels other than Corporate Affairs, notify the Kmart Corporate Affairs team at KmartCorporateAffairs@kmart.com.au and the compliance team at regulatory.affairs@kmart.com.au.
