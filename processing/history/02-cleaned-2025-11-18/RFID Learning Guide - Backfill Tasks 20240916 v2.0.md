# Digital Backfill Tasks  
Learning Guide

Previously, backfill processes were manual and cumbersome, taking team members away from delivering outstanding customer service and enhancing the shopping experience.

With RFID and Tory, the process is different.

Tory performs a store run each morning, reading RFID tags to see which items are missing. This alerts team members to pick the missing items within the Backfill Task on the RFID app to fill the floor.

# Finding Backfill Tasks

1. Sign into the RFID app.  
2. The main screen will appear after sign in.  
3. Click the 'Backfill' tile to access backfill tasks.  
4. The loading data screen will appear briefly before backfill tasks appear.  
5. Select a task from the list. Tasks are broken down by department and fixture type (cage or rail).

# Performing Backfill Tasks

6. Once you select a task, you will see categories included within the task. Select a category.

7. To find the product, use the backfill pick page which provides product information including a picture, department/class category, name, style code, and colour.  
8. To locate the item, select "Show on map". The item will appear as a green marker on the store map.  
9. To zoom in on the map, use two fingers or the plus and minus signs on the screen.  
10. Use the back button to return to the pick page.

# Finalising the Pick

11. Once all items are found, select the checkbox confirming you have all items.  
12. Tap 'Confirm' to return to the category screen to select the next item.  
13. If an item can't be picked, the team member can attribute a reason by clicking the 'unable to pick' button.

Reason codes are as follows:  
Cannot locate tag with hand wand: for items that cannot be located after RFID wand use.  
Online/layby/click & collect bleed: for items that cannot be located after RFID use.  
MDU (minimum display units): for items that won't fit in their allocated space on the shop floor. A request should be made to the Digital Stores' Specialist team to reduce the MDU when required.  
Wall bleed: for items that have generated a backfill task incorrectly, where the item was already on the shop floor, such as a menswear item from the shop floor back wall plotted in the stockroom.

14. When all available items have been backfilled, the task screen will be blank with no more tasks to select.
