# Glass Breakages

Record the keycode or APN on the breakage sheet.

Use cut-resistant gloves when placing broken glass into the bin.

Wrap glass fragments in a suitable material, such as bubble wrap, before placing them in the dump master or skip bin.

Do not push items down if the bin is full. Ask a manager to organize the bin to be emptied.

When emptying the bin, request a two-person lift and wear safety glasses.

Update the action write-off sheet daily. Cross through items once they have been actioned on the PDT.
