Everseen SCO Technology Guide

SCO Technology is a software program applied to self-serve machines that detects certain alerts and provides videos to help the SCO team member identify scanning issues.

The alerts include no scans, basket base loss, and product switches.

No Scans & Basket Base Loss Intervention Process

Step 1  
The customer is transacting on a SCO and one of the following occurs: no scan or basket base loss.

Step 2  
The SCO will trigger an intervention. The SCO team member must scan their operator barcode to view and investigate the next screen.

The top of the screen shows the type of intervention, such as No Scan or Basket Base Loss. A video illustrates what item was not scanned correctly and has a green box highlighting it.

Step 4  
The SCO team member must examine each transaction carefully.  
Check the alert type at the top of the screen.  
Review the video to identify why the alert was triggered.  
Compare the items scanned on the POS with those in the bagging area to ensure accuracy.  
Ensure the SCO area is clean so that rubbish or clutter do not trigger false interventions.  
Multiple interventions may indicate theft.  
Know your top 10 product switch products (refer to the Shrink VMB).  
If the system did not scan an item correctly, blame the machine and rescanning may be needed.

Note  
SCO team members must watch the video for every intervention to understand why it was triggered.

Step 5  
After identifying the issue, the team member should rescanned any items not scanned correctly.

Note  
Which button do I select?  
Rescan Item: Use when a Kmart product has not been scanned and triggers an alert (no scan, BBL, or product switch).  
Rescan not required: Use when the product has already been scanned and displayed, or when a non-Kmart item triggers an alert, or when a Kmart product has multiple parts.

Step 6  
Once the intervention is resolved, the customer can continue with their transaction.

Product Switch Process  
Product switch occurs when a customer scans a barcode of a cheaper item to pay less for a more expensive product. This can happen by using a barcode sticker, a smaller item, or printed barcodes, possibly concealed in the customer’s hand or phone.

How does product switch work?  
Everseen has a list of products known to be used for switching. Not every item is registered.  
To register an item, provide Everseen with the product barcode and description. The system learns the product’s appearance from multiple angles.  
Once learned, the product is placed in go-live mode and will trigger an alert if used in a switch.  
If you know additional items that should be added, email lplossbox@kmart.com.au with the barcode and description.

Step 1  
A customer uses a barcode of a cheaper item to scan a more expensive item, triggering an intervention.  
The SCO team member must scan their operator barcode to view and investigate.

Step 2  
The top of the screen shows the intervention type, such as Product Switch.  
A video demonstrates the product switch, with a green box highlighting the item.

Step 3  
The SCO team member must investigate each transaction:  
Check the alert type at the top.  
Review the video to identify the cause.  
Compare scanned items with those in the bagging area.  
Ensure the SCO area is clean to prevent false triggers.  
Multiple interventions can indicate theft.  
Know your top 10 product switch items (refer to Shrink VMB).

Note  
Blame the machine if the scanner did not scan an item properly; rescanning may be required.  
Watch the video for every intervention to understand why it was triggered.

Step 4  
Rescan the product switch item with the correct barcode and verify all other items are scanned correctly.

Step 6  
Once the intervention is resolved, the customer can proceed.

Customer Service Examples  
Every customer should receive good service and not be accused of wrongdoing. Missed scans can be accidental. Follow the 4D's if facing a threatening situation and notify a manager immediately.

Scenario | Team Member Response  
A customer has an intervention for a missed scan and scans another item, causing a new alert. | Approach the SCO and say, "Hi, how are you today. It looks like an item didn't scan through. I'll clear this so you can re-scan the item."  
A customer scans a different barcode than the product. | Approach the SCO and say, "Hi, how are you today. It looks like the item didn’t scan properly. I'll clear this so you can re-scan the item."

How to Get the Best Results from Everseen  
Ensure the right team members are trained on SCOs and Everseen, skilled in managing queues and investigating alerts.  
Check every intervention carefully to reduce shrink.  
Maintain a clean SCO area to minimize false alerts.  
Assist customers in using SCOs properly and help those with large quantities to prevent no scans.  
Blame the system, not the person.  
If no alerts or videos are showing, or the dashboard is empty, raise an incident with the IT service desk immediately.
