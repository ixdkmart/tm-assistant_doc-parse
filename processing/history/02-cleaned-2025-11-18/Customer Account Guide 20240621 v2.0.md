# Customer Account Guide

## Overview

Kmart provides 30-day interest free credit to approved businesses. This allows the approved business customer to obtain goods before making payment. The business then has 30 days to submit their payment to head office.

This guide will assist stores in determining who is eligible for a customer account, and how to approve, create, process, and manage customer accounts.

Customer accounts are only available in Australian stores.

## Customer Account Application

Provide the customer with the application form available on KIT Customer Account Credit Application.  
Conduct reference checks using the form available on KIT Business Reference Checks.  
Referees will be listed on the completed application form.  
Applications up to $5000 can be approved at store level by the Store Manager.  
Applications above $5000 need to be emailed to Accounts Receivable ar@kmart.com.au for approval.  
Once an account has been set up, an increase in the credit limit can be approved by the Store Manager up to $5000 (maximum amount for all charges).  
Requests for increases above $5000 must be approved by Accounts Receivable and sent to ar@kmart.com.au.  
If the application is successful, create the customer account and complete Customer Account Approval and Customer Account Bank Details letters.  
Email the completed letters to the customer and cc ar@kmart.com.au.  
If the application is unsuccessful, complete Customer Account Rejection letter and forward to the customer.  
Create a file for the customer account in the back office. This file will retain all purchase orders and receipts for follow-up.

Note:  
Kmart does not offer credit accounts to individuals or sole trader applicants including those with an Australian Business Number.  
Accounts can only be paid via EFT.  
When a payment is submitted, Accounts Receivable will notify the store via email.  
All forms are located on KIT: Stores > Operations > Services > Living Desk > Layby/Accounts.

## Customer Account Creation

From the CC screen, select 1 K Mart Sales Application, then 3 Reports, then 8 Store Accounts and User Reports, then 2 Add a Store Account, then 7 Customer Account.  
The account number will auto populate; note this on the application form.  
Fill out all required fields using the tab button.  
Account name format: Surname followed by a comma then first name.  
Address format: first line the street address, second line the suburb and state/territory.  
Enter the approved dollar amount into maximum amount for one charge and for all charges.  
Press enter.  
Create a file for the customer account, including the approved credit application form, approval email for applications over $5000, and any business reference checks conducted.

## Customer Account Processing

At the service counter, ensure the customer provides a purchase order on business letterhead with the account number, amount, and description of the purchase.  
Keep the purchase order by the store.  
Sign on the register and select Layby or Account transactions > Customer Account.  
Enter the customer account number.  
Scan the approved items and press total; no payment is needed to finalise.  
Two receipts will print; one for the customer, one for store record.  
The store copy must be attached to the purchase order and retained in the customer’s account file.  
Wrap items in a black layby bag and tape the customer receipt to the bag, avoiding tape over print.  
If the account does not allow the transaction, it may be due to suspension for non-payment. The transaction cannot proceed until payment is made and the account reactivated.  
If the account allows processing but the transaction is voided mid-scanning, the account limit has been exceeded. Review the account for available credit.

## Purchase Order Example

Purchase orders should include: company letterhead, date (not older than a week), purchase order number (not generic or duplicate), customer account number, authorized purchaser, maximum allowed spend, items authorized for purchase, and company contact details.  
Validate the authorized customer ID by ensuring the name matches the ID. Only record the validation, do not retain other ID details.  
Before processing the charge, ensure the above items are checked and that the authorized customer name matches the ID presented.  
Do not record ID details, only validate the name.  
If unsure of the purchase order's validity, contact the company using the on-file contact details, not the number on the purchase order.

## Customer Account Payment

Customer account payments are made via EFT to Head Office.  
You will receive an email from Accounts Receivable with a store memo attached, showing the payment amount for a charge number.  
Sign on to the register and select Layby or Account transactions.  
Enter the charge number and select make a payment.  
Enter the payment amount as per the store memo and confirm.  
Select 'Other Tenders' tab, enter tender amount equal to the payment amount, and complete the payment.  
Attach the payment receipt to the memo and take it to the back office for processing.  
The completed payment causes a register error until processed through the Cash Management System.  
Payments must be processed on an activated register that is used for sales.

## Customer Account Cash Management System (CMS) Process

Log into CMS, select the Inputs tab.  
Enter account payments into the purple HO Customer Account Payments field; date defaults to the previous day.  
Select the register from the drop-down menu, enter the payment amount, and submit.  
Multiple payments on the same register can be entered as a total.  
Once submitted, payment appears on the Total Store Summary report against HO CA Payments.  
When completing the Weekly Cash Report, enter the HO CA Payment amount on line 61 to enable head office to credit the store.  
If a cash on hand error occurs, reverse the action and complete the cash management process on Sunday (or Monday for Sunday), to balance the register and customer accounts.

## Customer Account Follow Up

Review the Weekly Administration report each Monday for overdue accounts exceeding 30 days.  
Use the account number to access the Customer Account via Point of Sale (POS): select 1 K Mart Sales Application, 3 Reports, 8 Store Accounts and User Reports, 1 Display/Change a Store Account, 2 Customer Account.  
Leave the surname part blank to display all accounts.  
Print the list and page through each page, reviewing each account.  
Check the credit limit and compare with the credit application form.  
Ensure each account has the correct documentation.  
For accounts at 60 days, change status to 2 – requires authorisation.  
For accounts at 90 days, change status to 3 – not authorised.  
Email the account holder to notify them of overdue status and request payment or remittance advice.  
Record actions taken on the Action Sheet Template and retain in the account file.  
When the account is paid and no longer overdue, reset status to 1 – authorised.

## Customer Account Tax Invoice

To provide a copy of the tax invoice, access the account via the POS: select 1 K Mart Sales Application, 3 Reports, 8 Store Accounts and User Reports, 1 Display/Change a Store Account, 2 Customer Account.

Fill in the Customer Account – Customer Account Invoice template with the original purchase date, customer name and address, invoice/charge number, purchase order number, and item details (description, code, quantity, price).  
Verify that total matches the purchase amount.  
Save the invoice as a PDF file.  
Attach the PDF to an email and send it to the customer.

## Customer Account Tax Invoice - continued

Save the completed invoice as a PDF using the Save As function.

## Customer Account Review Process

Check that all customer accounts in POS have correct documentation matching the authorized account and limit.  
Use the Account Name Search in POS: select 1 K Mart Sales Application, 3 Reports, 8 Store Accounts and User Reports, 4 Store Accounts Name Search, 2 Customer Account.  
Leave the surname blank and print all accounts listed.  
Review each account in the list, compare credit limits with the application forms.  
Ensure all accounts have an applied credit application form.  
Store Manager can approve accounts with limits up to $5,000 by signing the application.  
Limits over $5,000 require Head Office approval, request sent to ar@kmart.com.au.

## Customer Account Troubleshooting

If a payment was processed incorrectly, void the last payment on the checkout by going to layby and accounts > void payment, entering the last payment amount.  
Refund items in full if charged to the wrong account, then reprocess with the correct account number.  
If an account holder is not paying, email ar@kmart.com.au with details to follow up.  
For incorrect or duplicate payments, email ar@kmart.com.au for correction.  
If a customer disputes a payment due to lack of purchase order or approval, email ar@kmart.com.au for approval to write off.  
Report potential fraud to your business partner and raise a profit protection incident.  
If a new account does not appear within 24 hours, ensure the account number is recorded; it can take one working day for searchability.
