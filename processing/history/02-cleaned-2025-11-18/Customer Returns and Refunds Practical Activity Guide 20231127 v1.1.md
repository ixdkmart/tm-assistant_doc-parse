# Customer Returns and Refunds Practical Activity Guide

The purpose of this guide is to ensure team member(s) know how to safely process a refund for our customers. It also provides an opportunity for team member(s) to practice the key steps of processing a return with their line manager at the service desk or central checkout.

Prior to completing the tasks in this guide, ensure the team member has successfully completed the Customer Returns and Refunds learning module on our Learning Hub.

The task activities can be done in groups of team members depending on the number of registers available at either the service desk or central checkout.

It should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The guide is divided into three parts.

# Part A: Completion of safety reminders checklist by the line manager with team member(s)

Go through the safety reminders checklist below with the team member at the service desk or central checkout.

## Safety Reminders Checklist

Ensure the service desk area is clean and tidy and free from trip hazards. Ensure return tubs are sorted correctly and maintained. Ensure the RLO/Faulty returns location is kept tidy. Ensure there is a designated location under the counter for refund slips signed by customers. Count the money in the register at the start of your shift. Wear your PT2 (for calling a manager if required). Have cut-resistant gloves nearby for items returned that are broken, like glass or sharps. Always greet the customer politely and explain you are there to help. If a customer approaches the service desk or central checkout to return an item without a receipt, use the PT2 to check in with the customer greeter to validate the customer. If a customer appears threatening, always adhere to the 5D's when dealing with threatening situations. Do not test or plug in returned electrical items if they have an electrical fault. Wear cut-resistant gloves when handling returned items that are broken glass or sharps.

# Part B: Practical demonstration given by the line manager with the team member(s) on how to process refunds

Use the steps below as a guide to demonstrate processing a refund. The manager can perform the demonstration first, then ask team members to perform the steps independently.

## Refund with a receipt (for a customer who changes their mind)

Log into the register by scanning your operator ID or entering it. Scan the customer receipt. Select the purchased item listed on the screen. Choose the type of return, such as "Changed mind." Select the reason for the return and press submit. Press Finish to start the refund process. Check how the customer originally paid. Select the payment method, e.g., cash. Confirm the cash amount and press OK. The system prints a new receipt and a store receipt for the customer to sign and return for filing.

## Refund without a receipt (for customer who changes their mind for purchases over $10)

Log into the register by scanning or entering your operator ID. Select the Refund/Repair option on the screen. Choose "purchased in store." Scan the barcode on the item. Select the return type, e.g., "Changed Mind." Choose the reason for return and press submit. Confirm the refund price and press OK. Select Total to finalize the refund. Enter the customer's ID (license number, first name, last name). Select ID type, e.g., driver's license. Press Done. Choose Exchange Voucher (never give cash back without a receipt; always select eVoucher only). Select the Exchange only option. The system prints three receipts: an eVoucher, a copy of the receipt for customer and authorized team member to sign, and an additional product return label for faulty items attached for the RLO process.

## Refund without a receipt (for faulty items purchased in store)

Log into the register. Select Refund/Repair. Choose "purchased in store." Scan the item's barcode. Select the item for return. Choose "Faulty Item." Select the reason and press submit. Press Finish to start the refund process. Choose Exchange Voucher (never give cash back without a receipt; always select eVoucher only). Choose Exchange only. The system prints three receipts: an eVoucher, a copy of the receipt for signing, and an additional return label for faulty products to be attached to the item for RLO.
