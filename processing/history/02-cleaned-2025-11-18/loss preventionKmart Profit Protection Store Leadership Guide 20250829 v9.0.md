Kmart Profit Protection Store Leadership Guide

Introduction

Profit Protection is an organized effort by a business to reduce losses of revenue such as inventory controls, internal and external theft, supplier fraud or error, etc. At Kmart, a dedicated team is assigned to assist key stakeholders in reducing these losses through: supporting and educating stores/DCs in Profit Protection; store audits to ensure processes are followed; systems provided to identify and analyze unusual activity and transactions; reporting shrinkage results, stock adjustments, system overrides; review and development of systems and processes; investigations into suspected theft (external and internal).  

It is also the responsibility of store teams to complete tasks and identify opportunities to keep shrinkage minimal, including maintaining accurate stock on hand, completing stocktakes and investigations, adhering to Merchandise Protection Standards, training team members, filling customer greeter roles with qualified team members, reviewing communications, being aware of high shrinkage areas, and completing audits and checklists on time.

What is Shrinkage?

Shrinkage is the reduction in business takings due to wastage or theft of merchandise. It occurs across all areas including stores, distribution centers, the national office, and online.

Shrinkage happens daily through external and internal sources, including customers, team members, suppliers, and delivery drivers. Identification methods include stocktakes, gap scans, hotline and whistleblower policies, technology such as CCTV and Everseen, incident reporting, cash management, audits, and shrinkage analysis.

The store team’s role is to reduce shrinkage by investigating issues immediately, conducting audits, ensuring Standards are followed, keeping staff informed, and analyzing results regularly.

Profit Protection Awareness

Everyone has a role in reducing shrinkage. Awareness of policies and processes promotes safety and effective prevention.

Keeping up to date with communications helps prevent shrinkage. Recognize team members for their efforts. Report all incidents into Auror; safety incidents into Solvsafety. Ensure all team members follow correct processes, including refund policies and SCO interventions. Be familiar with high-risk areas. Conduct investigations into inventory issues. Speak up if suspicious activity is observed.  

Effective awareness helps maintain a secure, compliant store environment.

Best practices:
Ensure trained staff manage queues and investigate alerts. Maintain tidy SCO areas. Assist customers to use SCOs properly. Review system dashboards weekly for alerts and performance.
