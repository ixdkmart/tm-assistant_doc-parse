# Bicycle Assembly Process

## Selling Area

Store Area: Leisure Manager

Work is performed prior to the visit from the Hunter Service representative, during and after the visit, when selling an assembled bicycle to a customer, and in maintaining standards of the bicycle unit.

### Activity Steps

#### Prior to visit

Perform a visual check of the bicycle unit to determine the number of bicycle checklists requiring replacement.

Ensure appropriate space is available for the assembly of bicycles, not on the selling area.

Make sure bicycles requiring assembly and/or repair are ready and accessible for the Hunter Service representative.

Ensure the designated work area is safe and free from obstructions.

#### During visit

Clearly communicate the work required to the Hunter Service representative, whether it is repair work or assembly of bicycles, and the number of assembly checklists that need replacing as per the visual check.

Sign work invoices promptly for the completion of agreed works, ensuring all bicycles on the display unit have a completed Hunter Service Assembly Checklist attached by cable ties to the top tube or handlebar of the bicycle.

Attach the manufacturer warranty and instruction booklet to the bicycle seat post of assembled bicycles.

Discuss and agree on the following week's assembly and/or repair requirements, including any promotional or lay-by potential requirements.

Discuss the need for additional visits within the same week if required due to higher than normal sales expectations.

### Ongoing Post Visit (maintaining bicycle unit standards)

Rectify missing Point of Sale material from the bicycle display unit as discussed with the Hunter Service representative.

Install Point of Sale material as required, highlighting to the customer:
- The assembly charge of $16.50.
- That bicycles are sold in cartons, and display models are not for sale; bicycles are to remain in the unit.

Attach the Hunter Service Assembly Checklist, completed by an authorized Hunter Service representative, to the top tube or handlebar of all display bicycles.

Attach the manufacturer warranty and instruction booklet to the bicycle seat post of all assembled bicycles.

### When selling a display or sample bicycle

The customer is not charged the bicycle assembly fee when:
- The display model is a clearance item.
- The display model is the last stock on hand of that model.

Ensure that a K412 Soiled & Damaged Stock Sticker (keycode 36411863) is displayed on any previously returned bicycle being sold, including a completed Hunter Service Assembly Checklist, manufacturer warranty, and instruction booklet.
