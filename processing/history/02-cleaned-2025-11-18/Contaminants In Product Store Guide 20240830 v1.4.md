# Contaminant in Product Guide

## Objects in Products

There may be instances where stores or customers identify foreign objects within or on products such as metal contaminants (for example, blades, needles, clippers, etc.). Contaminants are generally identified in two ways: either in store during decant or on the shop floor by team members or customers, or by a customer after purchase.

Note: This process excludes syringes (used/unused). Dispose of syringes in store using the sharps container found in the sharps disposal kit.

## Identified during Decant or on Selling Floor

When a product is identified during decant or while merchandised on the selling floor, stores must follow this process:

Finding a contaminant:
During decant, any foreign objects such as blades, needles, or clippers found by team members should be immediately passed to the decant facilitator for action. The decant facilitator should capture relevant product information, such as keycode and description, and take photos of the carton, product, and contaminant. The facilitator should then pass the object, information, and photos to a manager for reporting.

On the selling floor, foreign objects found by customers or team members should be immediately reported to a manager. The manager must attend to the incident and if it involves a general merchandise product, obtain the product's foreign object and details. If it involves clothing, obtain the item with the needle or foreign object still in place. If a syringe is identified (used or unused), dispose of it in the sharps container using the sharps disposal kit. Appropriate safety equipment such as safety gloves must be worn when handling the objects.

If a needle is found in an apparel item, conduct a check of nearby products on the same rack for additional contamination. Ensure safety gloves are worn during this check. If multiple items with needles are found, indicating a targeted contamination, the manager must escalate the incident immediately to the Compliance team and Zone Manager for further instructions.

Important: Be mindful of customer perceptions regarding foreign objects, especially needles, due to recent food incidents. Reassure the customer that the incident will be reported immediately and the contaminant and product (if apparel) will be sent for investigation.

## Reporting Identified Contaminant

The manager must complete a hazard report in SolvSafety before the end of the shift, including relevant product information. A copy of the report should be printed and sent with the object. The object (if apparel or contains a needle) must be sent via internal mail to:
Customer Service,  
Level 3, Mulgrave.  
Note: Syringes and sharp containers must not be sent to CSC.

Photos related to the incident should be emailed to the customer service centre, including the incident report reference number.

Note: For apparel items with a needle, it is preferable to retain the actual product with the needle still in place to assist investigation.

## Identified after Purchase

If a customer reports finding a foreign object after purchase, depending on whether they return to the store or contact the store remotely, the process is as follows:

If the customer returns to the store:
The manager should be contacted to assist the customer, obtain the object, and relevant customer and product details. The manager must complete a hazard report in SolvSafety before the end of the shift with all relevant information.

If the customer contacts the store:
Obtain relevant information, including customer details, product details, and object description. Request the customer to provide the actual object or images if available. The manager must complete a hazard report in SolvSafety before the end of the shift.

Important: Be mindful of customer perceptions regarding foreign objects, especially needles, and reassure the customer that the incident will be reported immediately and the contaminant sent for further investigation.

## Returning Contaminant

Print a copy of the hazard report from SolvSafety to send with the object. The object must be sent via internal mail to:
Customer Service,  
Level 3, Mulgrave.

If a customer reports an incident directly to CSC, CSC will contact the store to coordinate the return of the object if required.
