## Managing Offsite Storage  

1. Sign into the RFID app.  
2. You must connect the hand wand before completing this process. Instructions on connecting are provided on the following pages.  
3. Click the "OFFSITE" button from the main screen.  
4. On the offsite screen, two options will appear: "Pack bundle" and "Unpack bundle."  
   - Pack bundle is used to send stock to offsite.  
   - Unpack bundle is used to receive stock back from offsite.  

## Relocating to Offsite  

1. Press the "Pack Bundle" tile.  
2. Press "NEW" to create a new bundle number.  
3. Select a printer by choosing "Bundle Printer." For example, 'Bundle Printer 21' will print the label to Printer 21.  
4. Press 'OK' to confirm your printer selection.  
   - One label will be added to the store's control sheet.  
   - Four labels will be printed for each side of the pallet, FB2, or KC1.  
5. Press 'OK' once the bundle labels have printed successfully.  
6. Scan the bundle label's QR code with the PDT scanner or type in the bundle number.  

## Continuing to Relocate to Offsite  

7. Ensure the RFID hand wand is connected to the PDT and the 'achievement' settings are set to 'auto.'  
8. Start hand scanning. The 'Actual' count will increase as new tags are recognized. Ensure the environment is controlled to avoid picking up other EPCs accidentally.  
9. Review the EPC tags read by the hand wand and remove unwanted items by pressing the 'bin' icon.  
10. When satisfied, press 'FINALISE.'  
11. Press 'OK' when the confirmation appears, confirming relocation of EPC tags to offsite.  

Stock must be sent before the next Tory run. EPCs will be automatically added into the inventory count daily until stock is called back and relocated using the "Offsite" tile in the RFID app.  

12. Ensure pallets are properly labeled before sending. Attach bundle numbers to all four sides of the pallet, FB2, KC1, using the provided template.

4. Choose the area to move the stock to:  
   - FOH if moving to the shop floor.  
   - BOH if leaving stock in back of house for Tory to read. Ensure stock is within the correct container for proper processing.  
5. Press 'OK' when prompted, confirming the EPC tags are relocated back into the store.
