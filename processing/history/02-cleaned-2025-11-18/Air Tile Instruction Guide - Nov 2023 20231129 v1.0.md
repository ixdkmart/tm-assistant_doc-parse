# Air Tile Assembly Guide - Nov 2023

## What You Will Need
Alignment Tool  
Roller  
Cutter  
Photo Gloves  
Cutting mat

## Preparation
Remove the Air Tile from the clear protective sleeve and place it white side up.  
Place the alignment tool against one corner of the Air Tile. The tool must be in close contact with the tile along two sides.  
Peel back 2 to 3 inches of the white release paper from the corner of the frame opposite the tool. Crease the layer so the flap lays flat.  
Put on the photo gloves and brush any debris off the back of the customer's photo to ensure it is clean.  
Place the photo in the corner of the frame where the white layer has been peeled back. Be sure to align to the corner.  

## Attaching the Photo
Slowly peel away the white layer and roll the image onto the tile using the small roller. Roll over the entire photo in all directions pressing firmly to fully adhere the photo to the tile.  

## Trimming the Excess
Wear safety gloves when using a cutter.  
Flip the Air Tile face down and press firmly.  
Using the roller cutter, trim the excess photo on two sides. Hold the cutter at a slight angle to avoid damaging the panel. Press firmly for a clean cut.  

## Final Assembly
Place the finished Air Tile into the protective sleeve along with the 1 x adhesive squares for the customer to assemble before displaying the tile.
