# Counterfeit Note Detection Guide (AUS)

Counterfeit notes are an illegal imitation of currency. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud. This guide provides information on the security features of two types of Australian notes to help identify if a note is genuine or counterfeit.

## If You Identify a Counterfeit Note

Contact your manager immediately. Do not handle the note. Report the incident to your Profit Protection Business Partner and email your state police. If the state police choose not to conduct an investigation, complete the AFP Suspect Banknote Submission Form and send it to the address listed at the bottom of the form. Record the incident via Auror.

## Top Tips to Identify Counterfeit Notes

There are two types of Australian currency notes with slightly different security features: First Polymer Series Notes and New Polymer Series Notes. Here are the top tips to identify a counterfeit note for each type.

### First Polymer Series Notes

Check what it is made of. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner, and/or lighter than a genuine banknote. Scrunch the note in your hand. A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched up. Feel the distinctive texture of the dark printing. Run your finger across the portraits and numerals to feel the slightly raised print. Check the window to ensure the security features cannot be easily rubbed off. Hold the note up to the light; the Australian Coat of Arms should be visible under the print.

### New Polymer Series Notes

Check what it is made of. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner, and/or lighter than a genuine banknote. Scrunch the note in your hand. A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched. Feel the texture of the dark printing. Run your finger across the portraits and numerals to feel the slightly raised print. Look at the small clear window for an embossed image with a light and dark effect. Tilt the banknote to see a 3D image with a colourful border that appears raised, observe a number change direction within the building, and see colours change within a bird.

## List of Security Features - First Polymer Series Notes

The polymer substrate gives Australian banknotes a distinctive feel. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner, and/or lighter than a genuine banknote. Most counterfeits are printed on paper and can be easily torn. A genuine banknote should return to shape after scrunching.

The clear window should be an integral part of the banknote and not an addition. Check for the embossing in the window, such as a wave pattern in the $10 banknote window, and the value printed on the windows of $20, $50, and $100 banknotes. The $5 banknote window has no embossing.

Inside the window, diamond-shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides. When held to the light, these should line up to form a seven-pointed star within the circle.

When held up to the light, the Australian Coat of Arms should be visible as a shadow image. This is created by variations in the background printing on the plastic substrate.

Intaglio print is raised dark printing with a distinct feel. It can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and major design elements.

Background print consists of multi-coloured, multi-directional fine-line patterns. These patterns should be very sharp. Check for irregularities, such as less defined patterns or colour differences.

Tiny, clearly defined words known as microprinting are printed in the top left corner of the $5 banknote and near the portraits on other denominations. Most banknotes have their denomination microprinted in words, such as 'FIFTY DOLLARS'. The $10 banknote contains poems by AB 'Banjo' Paterson and Dame Mary Gilmore microprinted on it.

## List of Security Features - New Polymer Series Notes

Australian banknotes are printed on polymer, a type of plastic, which gives them a distinctive feel. A genuine banknote should return to shape after scrunching.

The top-to-bottom window is an integral part of the banknote. Check that the security features in the window cannot be easily rubbed off.

Tilt the banknote to see a three-dimensional image with a colourful border. The image will appear raised or recessed.

Tilt the banknote to see a bird move its wings and change colour in the top-to-bottom window.

Tilt the banknote to see colours change within a bird.

Reversing number is visible when the banknote is tilted; a number changes direction within the building, appearing forwards, disappearing, then appearing backwards.

Tilt the banknote to see a rolling colour effect. On one side, it appears as a prominent patch near the top corner; on the other side, it is within a bird shape.

Look for an image in a small clear window. The image is embossed with a light and dark effect and is an integral part of the banknote.

Feel the texture of the dark printing. It can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and numerals, as it is slightly raised.

Background print features multi-coloured, multi-directional fine-line patterns, very sharp. Check for irregularities like less defined patterns or colour differences.

Microprint, or tiny, clearly defined text, is present in multiple locations on the banknote.
