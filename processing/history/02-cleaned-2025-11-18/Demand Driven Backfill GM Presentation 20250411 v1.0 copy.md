Digital Stores roadmap

Key initiatives along the roadmap include RFID Khubs, Backfill Optimisation, Demand Driven GM backfill, Inventory Accuracy 2.1, Apparel Markdown, Digitised Replen, Product location maps, Task Engine, Kmart NZ Apparel RFID, and Kmart AU Apparel RFID.

The roadmap shows initiatives plotted along a curved path, with completed items marked with checkmarks (✓). The initiatives relate to retail store operations, inventory management, and RFID implementation across regions.

Agile delivery

Traditional delivery involves solution scoped, designed, developed, and then full launch, with value plotted against time.

Agile delivery involves incremental steps including solution scope, proof of concept, pilot, extended pilot, full launch, and additional functionality, with each step incorporating user feedback. Value increases incrementally over time.

Benefits include early access and use of the tool, early and frequent feedback opportunities, influence over next functionality priorities, and improved team satisfaction and productivity.

What do agile enhancements look like for stores?

Updated route planning, table clustering v1, and Pathfinder barcode scanning.

Single pick reduction, customised store-specific MDU's, and wall bleed reduction.

Identification of recalls or withdrawals from sale, near-time reporting via the Manager portal, and sound alerts for clearance, not on display, or no sales in 30 days.

# Page 6

Why are we changing?

Stores currently have an inconsistent approach to backfill completion, creating waste.

Focus on 100% completion of fixtures each week.

Order is based on store team preference with minimal data backing decisions.

Timing of fixture picking impacts volume coming out.

BOH congestion affects other store processes.

Use data-driven prioritisation to maintain or improve sales.

Benefits

EBIT REM BENEFIT is $2.53 million, saving 7 hours per store per week on backfill tasks, which is a 26% time saving.

Sales benefit is $12 million, representing a 1.75% sales increase, tracked through BOH keycodes.

On average, 30% fewer BOH fixtures are scanned weekly.

Units picked increase by 25% compared to pre-pilot stores completing 100% backfill.

Volume of cages driven to the shop floor increases by 9.5%.

Fixtures repeated during peak periods increase by 6.8, and in standard weeks by 1.9.

# Page 8

How value is unlocked

Fixtures prioritised by logic—right stock, right time—lead to increased stock being released from stockrooms and decreased BOH congestion.

Non-value fixtures are removed from workload, and fewer fixtures are scanned weekly.

Productivity in backfill picking and sequence packing improves.

New logic saves managers time in fixture selection.

# Page 9

Demand Driven Backfill

Prioritise fixtures daily, removing non-value fixtures, using dynamic logic to determine the percentage of locations to pick each week.

Key principles include prioritising valuable fixtures based on stock and time, maximizing stock pickup productivity, identifying fixtures to repeat weekly to maximise stock availability and sales, and achieving an average completion of 70% of total fixtures, saving REM and driving sales.

# Page 10

How will backfill change?

Prioritisation and thresholds will be introduced.

Fixtures are provided daily via the task engine on PDT.

Stores will only complete repeat fixtures if value is identified.

Stores are required to complete 100% of fixtures generated each day.

There is no need to complete all stockroom fixtures anymore.

Compliance is measured daily by comparing generated fixtures versus completed fixtures.

Additional fixtures cannot be added.

Reporting will shift to Power BI, replacing paper-based reports long-term.

Near-time reporting will be available soon in the Manager Portal.

# Page 11

What's not changing?

The calculation method for take quantities remains the same.

Scanning all keycodes in fixtures remains standard process.

Manifesting on time influences take quantity requirements.

SMS is calculated based on scanned versus expected figures.

Overstock scans reset keycode take quantities to zero.

Fixtures numbered 8900–8999 will not generate backfill tasks.

# Page 12

Introduction of prioritisation logic and thresholds

Currently, fixtures are all picked on Monday.

In future, fixtures will be scheduled across the week, e.g., fixtures 7001–7009 will be picked on different days, such as Monday, Wednesday, Friday, etc.

Targets aim to optimise locations at the right time, increasing stock flow to the floor and improving product availability.

Non-value fixtures not required for that week are marked as N/A.

# Page 13

Non-priority fixtures

WEEK 1–4: Fixture 8003 is not done ([Red X icon]) indicating it was not completed in the last 4 weeks.

WEEK 5: Fixture 8003 is added to the priority list ([Green checkmark icon]) regardless of previous status.

All fixtures will be backfilled over a rolling 5-week period.

Less than 5% of fixtures are expected to reach week 5.

Fixtures not scanned within 28 days will automatically be added to week 5 to maintain SMS integrity.

# Page 14

Repeat fixtures

Fixtures completed this week will have a green checkmark.

Fixtures with a dollar sign will be monitored; if score exceeds the threshold, they will be scheduled for repeat.

Fixtures will be added to the priority list the following day via circular arrows.

Storage shelves illustrate fixture statuses, including completion, monitoring, and repeat scheduling.

# Page 15

Workload planning

After 3 weeks, a baseline trend for average fixtures completed daily will be established for roster planning.

The weekly fixture target will be available each Monday via the Power BI report.

Review the daily task list and allocate team members accordingly. Tasks are sorted by number, with department and world visible, and can be filtered by world.

Fixtures not completed as planned will be recalculated and reprioritized for the next day. Repeat fixtures can be added daily, including weekends.

Remaining fixtures due during the week must be completed Mon–Sun, with 20% assigned each weekday.

# Page 16

Backfill task completion

All GM backfill tasks are created daily between 4.00 am and 5.00 am local time.

Fixtures are provided via the task engine on PDT.

Each fixture has a task card; team members will use the GM backfill pick filter and select the task card.

Only prescribed fixtures can be completed; no extras.

Repeat fixtures are only completed if value is identified.

Location refresh can be used to add value the next day.

Shop floor backfill and stockroom scan in/out functions remain available.

Current backfill functions will be disabled.

Mobile app interface shows fixture details, including fixture number, item, item number, price, and location (stockroom and floor location).

# Page 17

Task compliance

Compliance is measured daily by comparing generated fixtures against those completed.

Stores must complete 100% of fixtures each day.

For example, store 9999 generated 20 fixtures Monday with all completed; on Tuesday, the same. On Wednesday, 20 generated but only 10 completed, resulting in 50%. Overall compliance is 80.6%, with no carry-over.

Weekend completion and compliance are required during the pilot phase.

# Page 18

Reporting

Power BI reporting is available.

Paper-based reporting is phased out.

Dashboard interfaces display various metrics, progress, and visualizations, including future reports marked as "COMING SOON."

# Page 19

When priority logic works best

Scanning stockroom keycodes increases fixture priority; incorrect scanning reduces fixture value.

BOH fixture sortation based on lean standards allows efficient scanning and maintains SMS integrity.

Keeping multi-located keycodes under 5% increases fixture value and ensures the right quantity is filled.

Location refresh maintains accuracy and adds value to fixtures, promoting stock out of stockrooms.

Gap scans should be completed as per store task procedures.

# Page 20

Getting ready

Perform lean (5S) reset.

Complete location refresh and gap scans as per business-as-usual (BAU) processes during weeks 1–4.

Complete backfill 100% by the Friday before the go-live week.

Ensure multi-location fixtures are under 5%.

Roster team members appropriately and conduct team training.
