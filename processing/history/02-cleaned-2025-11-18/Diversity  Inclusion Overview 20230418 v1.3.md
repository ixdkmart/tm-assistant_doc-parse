# Diversity

Kmart's people plan and better together strategy aim to ensure that our business is a great place to shop, is right for everyone, and enables us to attract the best talent to sustain the growth of our business.

We will know Kmart is right for everyone when our stores, distribution centers, and offices reflect the communities in which we operate. This extends to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disabilities, and women in leadership roles.

Stay tuned to understand more about the FY17 plan.
