# Team Member Bag & Locker Check Process

This process aims to develop a culture of security awareness and assist in preventing Team Member dishonesty. It applies to all Kmart employees in Australia and New Zealand, including Store and National Office Team Members, according to their conditions of employment.

Kmart acknowledges that Team Members are hardworking and honest. They are recruited for these qualities. However, some Team Members do not always adhere to the code of conduct. This may include stealing from the business, such as taking, using, or eating merchandise without paying, or taking cash from cash registers.

All Team Members must present their bag(s) that are A4 size or larger when exiting a store for a security check. This applies at all exit points and on all occasions.

## Team Member Bag Check Conditions

In Tasmania, only Team Members above 18 years old are permitted to conduct bag checks. All Team Members are expected to present their bags and contents for inspection before leaving the store, whether at the end of a shift, during a store visit, or during a break.

Team Members must open segments of their bags A4 or larger for a security check by a Team Member or Manager before exiting the store. 

When conducting a security check, the Team Member or Manager must ensure the following:
The person performing the check is trained in how to do it.
The check is visible on a CCTV camera.
They must not interfere with the contents of the bag and should request the Team Member to move items for a clearer view.
Security guards are also authorized to conduct bag checks.

## Team Member Bag Check Process

Step 1: The Team Member approaches the Customer Greeter or Manager with their bag and opens it to show contents.

Step 2: The Customer Greeter or Manager reviews the contents visually.

Step 3: If objects inside block the view, the Team Member may be asked to move items for better visibility.

Step 4: Once checked, the Team Member can leave the store.

It is encouraged to develop a culture where Team Members voluntarily present their bags when leaving.

## Team Member Locker Check Process

Kmart conducts routine security checks of lockers used by Team Members. Individual checks only occur if:
The Team Member is present during the check, or
The Team Member has given permission for the search in their absence on each occasion.

If a search occurs in the Team Member’s absence, they may nominate another Team Member to be present. This does not apply in emergency situations or if there is a health or safety risk.

If a locker, bag, or parcel is searched without the Team Member’s permission or presence, the Team Member must be notified within three business days.

## IT Equipment

Kmart loses many IT devices weekly, including Push to Talk devices, PDTs, and Body Cameras. These devices should not be left in lockers or taken home. Devices must be returned at the end of each shift for charging and readiness.

If a Team Member accidentally takes a device home, they must return it to the store as soon as possible.
