Digital Stores roadmap

Key elements along the roadmap include RFID Khubs, Backfill Optimisation, Demand driven GM backfill, Inventory Accuracy 2.1, Apparel Markdown, Digitised Replenishment, Product location maps, Task Engine, Kmart NZ Apparel RFID, and Kmart AU Apparel RFID.

These elements are arranged along a curved road path, with checkmarks indicating completed items. The roadmap shows various digital store initiatives and their implementation status.

Agile delivery

Traditional delivery:
A single horizontal line shows "Solution scoped, designed and developed" followed by a vertical "Full launch" bar.

Agile delivery:
A stepped approach shows incremental progress with steps including solution scoped, proof of concept launched, pilot launch, extended pilot, full launch, and additional functionality. Each step shows "User Feedback Incorporated".

Key Benefits:
Early access and use of the tool; early and frequent opportunities for feedback; ability to influence the priority of the next functionality built; improved team satisfaction and productivity.

# Page 5

What do agile enhancements look like for stores?

Updated route planning, table clustering v1, Pathfinder barcode scanning.
Single pick reduction, customised store-specific MDU's, wall bleed reduction.
Identification of a recall/withdrawal from sale, near-time reporting through the Manager portal, sound alerts for clearance, not on show or no sales in 30 days.

# Page 6

Why are we changing?

We have an inconsistent approach to backfill completion across stores, with a significant opportunity to reduce waste in the process.

Focus on 100% completion of all fixtures each week.

Order determined by store team’s preference with minimal data backing decisions.

Timing of fixtures picked impacts volume coming out.

Congestion in back-of-house affects other processes throughout the store.

Maintain or improve sales by using data-driven prioritisation (right fixture, right time).

Benefits

EBIT REM BENEFIT
$2.53m
Seven hours saved per store per week on backfill task, a 26% reduction.

SALES BENEFIT
$12m
A 1.75% sales increase, tracking performance of back-of-house keycodes.

Fixtures picked:
On average, 30% less back-of-house fixtures are scanned per week.

Units picked:
On average, a 25% increase compared to pre-pilot stores completing 100% backfill.

Volume:
A 9.5% increase in cages driven to the shop floor.

Repeat locations:
Fixtures repeated during peak periods increased by 6.8; in standard weeks, fixtures repeated increased by 1.9.

How value is unlocked

Fixtures prioritised by logic—right stock, right time.
Increased volume coming out of stockrooms.
Decrease in back-of-house congestion.
Non-value fixtures removed from workload.
Less fixtures scanned across in the week.
Productivity increases in backfill pick and sequence pack away.
New logic saves managers time in fixture selection.

# Page 9

Demand Driven Backfill

Daily fixture prioritisation removes non-value fixtures using dynamic logic to determine the percentage of total locations to pick each week.

Key elements:
Prioritise the most valuable fixtures based on the right stock, right time.
Pick the maximum stock productively.
Identify fixtures to repeat weekly to maximise stock availability and sales.
Average completion of 70% of total fixtures, saving REM and driving sales.

# Page 10

How will backfill change?

Prioritisation and thresholds will be introduced.
Fixtures will be provided daily via task engine on the PDT.
Stores will only complete the same (repeat) fixture if value is identified.
Stores are required to complete 100% of fixtures generated each day.
There is no longer a need to complete 100% of total stockroom fixtures.
Compliance is measured daily on the number of fixtures generated versus completed.
Additional fixtures cannot be added.
Reporting will be in Power BI, replacing paper-based reporting long term.
Near time reporting will be available soon in the Manager Portal.

# Page 11

What's not changing?

There will be no change to how take quantities are calculated.
Scanning all keycodes in fixtures remains the same process.
Manifesting on time affects the required take quantities.
SMS is calculated based on what is scanned versus expectations.
Scanning away overstocks resets keycode take quantities to zero.
Fixtures with keycodes between 8900 and 8999 will not generate backfill tasks.

# Page 12

Introduction of prioritisation logic and thresholds

Current state:
All fixtures picked on a Monday: 7001, 7002, 7003, 7004, 7005, 7006, 7007, 7008, 7009.

Future state example:
Fixtures are scheduled on different days, e.g., Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Tuesday, Thursday, with non-value fixtures not required to backfill that week (N/A).

This targets the right locations at the right time, maximising stock volume coming out and improving product availability.

# Page 13

Non-priority fixtures

Weeks 1-4:
Fixture 8003 shows as not done with a red X icon.

Week 5:
Fixture 8003 is added to the priority list regardless of previous status, shown with a green checkmark.

Note:
Fixtures not scanned within 28 days will automatically be added to week 5 to maintain SMS integrity.
Less than 5% of fixtures are expected to reach week 5 over a rolling 5-week period.

# Page 14

Repeat fixtures

Fixtures can be marked as completed this week with a green checkmark.
Fixtures above a certain score threshold will be provided for repeat.
Fixtures will be automatically added to the priority list the following day with circular arrows.

# Page 15

Workload planning

After three weeks, a baseline trend for average daily fixtures will be identified to create a new roster.
Number of fixtures to complete each week will be available every Monday via Power BI.
The daily task list will be reviewed, and team members allocated fixtures.
Tasks are sorted numerically, with filtering available by world for easy allocation.
Fixtures not completed on the prescribed day will be rescheduled for the next day.
Repeat fixtures may be added daily, including weekends.
Uncompleted tasks will generate additional fixtures for the following week.

Two circular indicators:
Prescribed fixtures must be completed Monday through Sunday.
Twenty percent of prescribed fixtures are allocated each weekday.

# Page 16

Backfill task completion

All GM backfill tasks are generated daily between 4:00am and 5:00am local time.
Fixtures are provided via task engine on PDT.
Each fixture has a task card; team members will use the GM backfill pick filter to select the task.
Only prescribed fixtures can be completed; additional fixtures are not allowed.
Stores will only complete repeat fixtures if value is identified.
Location refresh remains available and adds value to fixtures the following day.
Shop floor backfill, stockroom scan in/out functions remain available.
Current backfill function will be disabled.

# Page 17

Task compliance

Stores must complete 100% of fixtures generated each day.
Compliance is measured daily comparing fixtures generated vs. completed.
An example table shows:
Monday: 20 generated, 20 completed, 100% compliance.
Tuesday: 20 generated, 20 completed, 100% compliance.
Wednesday: 20 generated, 10 completed, 50% compliance.
Thursday: 30 generated, 30 completed, 100% compliance.
Friday: 20 generated, 5 completed, 25% compliance.
Saturday: 15 generated, 15 completed, 100% compliance.
Sunday: 4 generated, 4 completed, 100% compliance.

Weekend completion and compliance are required during the pilot.

# Page 18

Reporting

Power BI reporting is available.
Paper-based reporting has been phased out.

Reporting dashboards show metrics such as performance percentages, progress, backfill statistics, compliance data, visualizations over time, and tabular completion status.

# Page 19

When priority logic works best

Stockroom keycodes should be scanned in to increase fixture priority.
Fixtures should be neat and tidy to allow efficient scanning, driving high SMS integrity.
Multi-located keycodes should be kept under 5% to maintain high fixture value.
Location refresh maintains fixture quantities, adding value and driving stock out of stockroom.
Gap scans should be completed as per store task tool.

# Page 20

Getting ready

Perform lean (5S) reset.
Complete location refresh and gap scans as per business-as-usual procedures during weeks 1 to 4.
Backfill should be completed 100% by the Friday before going live.
Action multiple locations where under 5%.
Team members should be rostered, and team training completed.
