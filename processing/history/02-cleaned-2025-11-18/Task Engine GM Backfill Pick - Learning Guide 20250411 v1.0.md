Task type and World filter options are available via the filter button. The screen may show 4 of 24 tasks. Each task card displays the task description, fixture number, most common world in this fixture, total keycodes scanned, and most common department.

To refresh the task list, swipe or pull down the screen. The Task Engine fetches new data every 30 seconds.

## Completing a GM Backfill Pick task
To filter tasks by type, select the filter function. Choose to filter by Task Type to only display GM Backfill Pick tasks, optionally filtering by World.

The task list will now display only GM Backfill Pick tasks in Kids World.

Open a task by selecting the task card. Scan the fixture location barcode with the PDT or type in the fixture number using the keyboard icon. Once accepted, scan the barcode of the first item in the fixture, working from left to right, top to bottom.

Product information displayed includes:
The fixture location currently in progress.
The "In Progress" tab shows the most recently scanned product info.
The "Take" number indicates the minimum quantity to be picked. If 0, scan the next item.
The locations where the product is scanned on the shopfloor and in the stockroom.
A keyboard for typing in an APN or keycode if the barcode cannot be scanned.
If you are picking the last one of this keycode, ensure this is selected to scan the keycode out of the fixture location.

## Completing a task (continued)
After scanning the barcode, the "Take" number indicates the minimum quantity to take. If less than that is in the fixture, take all. Scan the barcode of the next item to continue. If "Take" is 0, the item does not need to be picked and you can scan the next one. If the product is in more than one location, enter the quantity picked from this location.

When all keycodes have been scanned and quantities picked, press "Finalise Backfill". Before finalising, check for any missed keycodes. Your task will be removed from the home screen upon completion, and you can proceed to the next task.

## Troubleshooting
For errors like invalid fixture barcode, ensure you scan the correct fixture barcode matching the task. If the scanned fixture does not match, re-scan the correct fixture barcode. If the fixture has already been scanned, proceed to scan a product keycode.

If a product is recalled or withdrawn, do not place it on the shop floor. Move it to the recall bag immediately and delete it from the fixture after removal.

For errors such as "Something went wrong" or "Lost connection":
Pull down the app to refresh. Ensure network coverage and Wi-Fi signal. If the error persists, log out and log back into the Task Engine. If still unresolved, reboot the PDT. If issues continue, contact the IT Service Desk.

For lost connection with no tasks displayed, refresh the app, ensure network range, and log out and in again if needed.
