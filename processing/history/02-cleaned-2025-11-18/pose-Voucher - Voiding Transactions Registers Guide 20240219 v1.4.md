# Voiding e-Vouchers: registers

## During the transaction (void total)
During the transaction, until the transaction has been finalized, you can void the transaction by pressing void and then total. This will also put the value back onto the e-Voucher to be used again.

## e-Voucher Multi tender transaction
If the full e-Voucher has been redeemed, but there is still an amount owing, the transaction can still be void totaled. The amount taken off the e-Voucher will automatically go back onto the e-Voucher.

## After the transaction (void previous)
As e-Vouchers go through the EFT system, you cannot perform a void previous on them (total 10 non-sales). You need to process it as a refund by following the specified process. This is only to be processed on a service desk register.

## e-Voucher Completed transactions
If you have redeemed an e-Voucher and find it to be incorrect, follow these steps: Deface the voucher and place it in the cash drawer to be sent to the cash office at the next clearance, as the voucher still needs to be accounted for. Take the goods to the service desk to issue a new e-Voucher. Process the sale correctly using the new e-Voucher.
