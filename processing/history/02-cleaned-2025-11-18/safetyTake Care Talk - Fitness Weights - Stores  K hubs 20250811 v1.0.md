Feel free to adjust this message to a style that suits you and your team.  
If this Take Care Talk is part of a safety activity, record completion via the H&S Quicklinks page or scan the QR code.

### Purpose
To raise team members' awareness of recent incidents involving fitness weights and the safe handling, transport, and merchandising of fitness weights.

### Risks Associated with Fitness Weights
Our active range and fitness weights are popular products.  
If not handled, transported, and merchandised correctly, they pose a risk to team members and customers.  
Risks include dropping weights on hands and feet during sequence or refresh.  
Muscular sprain or strain injuries from repetitive filling or decanting of weights.  
Lifting a single kettlebell or dumbbell without checking its weight.  
Weights falling off H-Cages.  
Customers dropping weights on their hands or feet, including over 16 incidents involving young children.

### Conversation starters
Ask how we can keep team members and customers safe when handling, transporting, and merchandising fitness weights.

### Actions
1. Warm up before each shift to activate muscles.
2. Wear safety footwear and gloves when working in decant, online, or moving H-Cages with heavy weights.
3. Take mini breaks and rotate tasks to avoid repetitive handling and filling of weights.
4. Use four-sided or wraparound H-Cages to move weights, preventing them from falling or rolling out.
5. Place weights in a tote on the lower shelf of an H-Cage to prevent falling or rolling out. Do not overload totes; the safe working load is 16 kgs.
6. Ensure the H-Cage is not overloaded with weights or difficult to move. Remove stock if necessary.
7. Follow planograms to merchandise and refresh fitness weights. Do not double stack dumbbell Shelf Ready Packaging or hex dumbbells. Turn hex dumbbells longways onto the shelf to prevent rolling. Keep within shelf capacity limits. Ensure the locking mechanism is in place for weight plate stands.
Note: K hubs do not have planograms, but this merchandising guidance still applies.

### Bring this Take Care Talk to Life
Take relevant team members to the fitness weights fixtures on the selling floor and demonstrate safe merchandising of fitness weights according to the planogram.  
Note: K Hubs should follow the merchandising guidance in point 7.

### Leadership observation
Check that fitness weight displays are merchandised according to planograms, including shelf capacity, notch guidance, use of decks and risers where specified, and planogram safety alerts.  
Note: K hubs should follow the guidance in point 7.  
Walk through areas where fitness weights are stored or handled (decant, stockroom, online, click & collect).  
Ask team members for ideas to improve safe handling, transport, and storage of fitness weights.  
After the Take Care Talk, check in with team members throughout the shift to ensure they understand hazards and control measures related to handling, transporting, and merchandising fitness weights.
