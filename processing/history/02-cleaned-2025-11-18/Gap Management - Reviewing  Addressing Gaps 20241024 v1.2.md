## Gap Management: Reviewing & Addressing Gaps

### Why
Reviewing and addressing gaps is vital to ensure a high store presentation standard is maintained and to maximize sales.

### Who
All shop floor members.

### When
Gaps should be reviewed and addressed when an Out of Stock (OOS) label has been laid for an item.

### How
Follow the steps below.

### Safety
Apply moving safely techniques. Ensure merchandise is placed securely on pegs and shelves. Use a safety step when working above shoulder height or below waist height.

### Getting Started

### Whole Gap
If the gap size is greater than 1, cover fully. If less than 1, leave the item.

### Shelf Module
Assess the gap size applicable to the module.

### Process
1. Your manager will instruct you on which areas to review for gaps.
2. For each gap with an OOS label, determine the size of the gap.
3. Check the OOS label to see what action is required based on the size of the gap. If it says "Cover," proceed to cover the gap.
4. If coverage is needed, check if there is enough stock of an adjacent item to cover the gap fully. Start by checking to the left, then to the right if there isn't enough stock on the left.
5. If there is no stock on either side or if you would need to change the shelves or pegs, cover the gap by spreading the available stock across the empty shelves or pegs.
6. When you have finished reviewing gaps, inform your manager.

### Management Review
7. The manager may decide to dress the side with other products. Use overstock or products from the same category to dress the side, keeping the fittings and OOS labels in place.
8. If you need to change the fittings to dress the side, put all OOS labels on the bottom shelf.
9. Place shelf edge labels for the temporary products and highlight the labels. This will identify the labels that can be removed when stock arrives for the side.
