# Empty Packets & Glass Breakage Process

## Empty Packets

Empty packets are the packaging taken off products sold within Kmart. They are often hidden or concealed within the store, in both obvious and hidden areas. Identifying empty packets indicates theft in a store. All store teams must be aware of hot spot areas for empty packets and what to do if they find them.

High-volume areas for empty packets include change rooms (behind mirrors, under fitting room seating), back of the bike units, shed area (home décor), cosmetics area, areas with little customer traffic, and back of house areas such as stock rooms and tea rooms.

Each store may have different keycodes that identify an empty packet. It is important to know your store’s top empty packet keycodes to be aware and create a stronger presence in those areas. This information is obtained from the number of empty packet adjustments under code 21.

To reduce empty packets, keep your team informed regularly on the results. Create a red route and encourage the team to walk these areas during shifts, breaks, or when leaving the store. Know your empty packet hotspot areas and encourage the team to patrol them frequently. If empty packets or suspicious activity is observed, report it immediately to a manager. Know your store’s Persons of Interest (POI) and reach out to your Profit Protection Business Partner for assistance.

Empty packet bins should be set up in the back of house area. Team Members must place identified empty packets into these bins for counting and write-off using adjustment code 21. Example setups include bins labeled for different departments like "Kids World Empty Packets," "Clothing World Empty Packets," and "Home World Empty Packets."

## Empty Packet Bin Signage

Stores should set up empty packet bins by world and place the provided signage on each bin to clearly identify the world. It is the responsibility of all managers to review the empty packets in their area and write them off using adjustment code 21. The signage is located on the Kit: Kit > Stores > Profit Protection > Tools.

## Managing Empty Packet Process

Step 1: All team members identify and remove empty packets from their location.

Step 2: Report findings to a manager, providing details on where the empty packets were found, any suspicious activity, the time located, and a description of the empty packets. Provide as much detail as possible to assist with CCTV review.

Step 3: The manager notes the details and places the empty packets into the relevant world empty packet bins.

Step 4: Managers communicate high-volume empty packet locations during team huddles to promote patrol and deterrence.

Step 5: Managers ensure empty packets are adjusted weekly using code 21, or daily in high-volume stores.

## Additional Guidance

If empty packets are found in back of house areas, they should still be reported to a manager for investigation. Managers should consult with their Profit Protection Business Partner in such cases.

For high-volume empty packet areas with no cameras, contact your Profit Protection Business Partner for assistance.

If empty packet bins fill within one day, the store is classified as high-volume. Managers must write off these packets daily using adjustment code 21 and inform their Profit Protection Business Partner.

Teams should be encouraged to identify high-volume empty packet areas and discuss strategies to reduce these by frequent patrols and awareness during team huddles.

## Glass Breakages

Glass products often break in store and must be handled with care to prevent injury. All managers are responsible for ensuring the process for disposal is followed and recorded in the Glass Breakages Bin Write Off Form.

## Glass Breakages Setup & Signage

Every store must have a glass breakage bin set up in the back of house area next to the empty packet bins. The bin should not exceed 130 litres in size. Bins can be ordered from Blackwoods (code 03469520). Attach the Glass Breakages signage to the bin and place a copy of the write-off form on a clipboard attached above the bin.

## Glass Breakages Process

Step 1: Identify a broken glass product. Using cut-resistant safety gloves, carefully remove the glass and place it into the designated glass breakages bin.

Step 2: Record the broken item on the glass breakages bin write-off form.

Step 3: Managers must review the bin and arrange weekly write-offs, or daily in high-volume stores.

Step 4: When emptying the bin, use a two-person lift with both team members wearing cut-resistant gloves and safety glasses. Both should handle the bin carefully and dispose of its contents into the dumpster.

It is important never to push down contents when placing broken glass or sharp items into the bin, as this may cause injury. If the bin is full, ask your manager to organize for it to be emptied.

If a product has missing items but the remaining items are saleable, the remaining set can be sold as soiled or damaged. Ensure there are no broken fragments remaining in the box before sale.
