Process each item by scanning or entering details. Continue until all items are processed.  

## Empty Packets and Soiled and Damaged Reports

Mandatory reports are printed each Monday for the previous week, in detail and summary, for review and filing for 12 months.  

Further information is available in the Back Office Manual Volume 1, tab 4, covering search functions, report printing, and adjustments.

# Cleanliness

## Introduction  
Australian health regulations mandate clean food storage areas.  

## Presentation  
Maintain a clean, well-titled, and attractive sale area. Check for damaged or open packets daily. Dust and clean shelves weekly. Manage stock for fresh use-by dates. Remove expired items and stock passed its date. Display off the floor and keep checkouts tidy.

## Spilt food products  
Clean immediately. Record and dispose of broken or open packets.

## Dirt and debris on packaging  
Clean to prevent spoilage and maintain appearance.

## Pests  
Eradicate pests such as moths, rats, mice, and birds. Seal entry points and prevent contamination. Store nuts, birdseed, and fish food away from consumables.

## Garbage disposal areas  
Locate bins away from food storage. Empty and clean regularly.

# Replenishing Selling Area

## Who?  
Managers and authorized team members.

## When?  
After deliveries or daily requisitions. Use stock with the nearest use-by date. Rotate stock to front/back accordingly.

Follow steps: Take merchandise to the sales floor, check shelf date codes, move stock with the closest expiry forward, replace or fill shelves, and record the use-by date on cartons.

# In the receiving area

## Handling  
Treat pallets carefully to avoid damage, contamination, or loss due to broken packets. Check for damage and leaks, isolate affected stock, and notify the buyer.

## Temperature and moisture  
High heat and moisture spoil food. Store in a cool, dry location, off the floor, away from heat sources or west-facing walls.

## Glass containers  
Record and discard damaged glass-packaged products immediately. Report prior damage to the buyer or supplier.

## Checklist for the receiving area  
Keep the area clean, inspect for damage, handle food carefully, dispose of affected packets, and clear deliveries quickly.

# Receiving Stock at Store

## Who?  
Managers and authorized staff.

## When?  
Weekly deliveries, direct or via DC or GHPL.

Follow steps: receive, inspect, isolate damaged items, check date codes, raise claims if necessary, use existing stock to fill fixtures, or use new stock for display.

# Stockroom Management

## Principles  
Store off the floor, avoid high stacks, remove broken packaging, follow manufacturer instructions, store away from strong odors/damp areas, and avoid mezzanine storage.

## Stock rotation  
Check date codes regularly, rotate stock, reduce shelf life items to clear, and mark products with use-by month on cartons.

## Stacking  
Avoid fragile or heavy stacking; store on pallets or shelves.

## Paints and chemicals  
Store separately from food. Avoid odorous or toxic items near food products.

## Moisture and temperature  
Keep in dry, cool locations. Avoid storing on heat sources or west-facing walls. Use off-site storage for large or remote stores, especially in warm climates.

## Checklist for the stockroom  
Maintain a cool, clean, dry, pest-free environment. Store away from strong odors. Keep stock fresh and rotate correctly.

# On the shelf

## Introduction  
Cleanliness, stock rotation, and proper merchandising drive customer loyalty and sales.

## Cleanliness  
Clean shelves, remove damaged or open packets daily, and clear spills immediately.

## Stock rotation and use-by dates  
Replenish moving older stock forward. Check dates weekly, clear expired stock, and promote items nearing expiry for quick sale.

## Peg displays  
Use packaging with peg holes. Do not punch holes in seams; puncturing causes damage and spoilage.

## Temperature control  
Ensure proper store climate control. Do not display on the floor or in heat-damaged areas.

## Merchandising for quick sale  
Place discounted or high-traffic products prominently, like gondola ends or checkout areas.

## Checklist for food on shelves  
Maintain cleanliness, check for damage, rotate stock, clear expired items, and display older stock at the front.

# At the checkout

## Cleanliness and stock rotation  
Keep checkouts tidy. Rotate impulse stock to promote freshness.  

## Handling  
Handle fragile items gently. Pack heavy items at the bottom, fragile items on top.

## Checklist for checkout  
Maintain cleanliness, rotate stock, and handle products carefully.

# Weevil control

## What are weevils?  
Weevils are larvae of beetles/moths growing from eggs. They form cocoons called pupae, and moths lay eggs resulting in infestations.

## What to do  
Call pest control if moths are spotted.  

## How do weevils get into food?  
Eggs hatch inside unprocessed foods, they chew through packages, or migrate after being laid.

## What foods are affected?  
Dried fruits, nuts, coconut, oats, chocolates, pet food, birdseed, and fish food.

## Public health  
Infested foods are unfit for consumption. Selling or manufacturing such products can lead to prosecution.

## How to control?  
Ensure stock is rotated and store area is kept clean and free of spilt food and infestation sources.

## Additional steps  
Check stock, consult pest control contractors, and follow established procedures with authorities.

# Managing pet foods

## Introduction  
Freshness and appeal are critical due to pets' keen sense of smell.

## Dry pet food  
Store in a cool, dry place. Avoid sunlight. Be aware of oil rancidity and pest infestation.

## Canned pet food  
Handle carefully. Avoid damaged cans, especially swollen ones. Report issues to the buying department.  

## Checklist for pet foods  
Keep proper stock rotation, avoid heat/moisture, handle with care.

# Short Coded Merchandise

## Date Coding  
Identify products with a Best Before, Use By, Sell By, or Manufacturing date.  
Refer to Appendix 1 for details.

## Short Coded Merchandise  
Items with 4 or fewer weeks until expiry are short coded. Manage via:  
Replacement by supplier, credits, or markdowns.

## Supplier Credits / Replacement  
Always prefer credits or replacements. Refer to Appendix 2 for options.  
Follow the Decision Matrix (Appendix 3).

## When to Action a Markdown  
Apply when:  
Use-by is within 4 weeks, and no full credit or swap available.  

## Markdown Process  
Initial markdown is 30%. Subsequent markdowns are 50% weekly, until expiry.  
Expired products are written off as Soiled and Damaged.

## Merchandise Markdown Register  
All markdown actions must be recorded and signed. Refer to page 32.

# Actioning Short Coded Markdowns

## Who?  
Managers and authorized staff who signed the register.

## When?  
When product is within 4 weeks of expiry, no full credit is available, and stock remains unsold.

## Procedure  
Check if this is the first or subsequent markdown.  
First markdown: remove from display, apply 30% discount, and highlight with pricing gun.  
Second markdown: apply 50% discount.  
If product is out of code, write off as Soiled & Damaged and end process.

## Final notes  
Only authorized staff may action markdowns. Markdowns should be kept in designated areas separate from standard displays.  
All actions must be signed and recorded.
