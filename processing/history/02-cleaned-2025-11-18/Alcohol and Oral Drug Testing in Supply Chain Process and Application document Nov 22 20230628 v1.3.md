# Alcohol and Oral Drug Testing in Supply Chain - Process and Application

## Introduction and Purpose

Kmart is responsible for providing a safe workplace for its team members, contractors, and visitors. 

Distribution Centre environments are hazardous due to work conducted at heights, the use of heavy machinery, and mobile equipment, increasing the risk of serious injury or fatality. 

Anyone in the workplace who has consumed illegal or illicit drugs and/or alcohol or is taking medication that affects their ability to work safely presents a safety risk. This may affect job performance, endanger lives, and cause damage to Kmart property. 

Managing risks associated with illegal or illicit drugs, medications, and alcohol at work is essential to ensuring a safe work environment. 

Kmart is committed to taking all reasonable steps to ensure all persons on site are unimpaired by drugs or alcohol. 

The Alcohol and other drug testing in Supply Chain policy supports Kmart to ensure a safe and productive environment for everyone working or visiting a Kmart site, reduces workplace incidents, addresses behavior not in line with our code of conduct, and improves work performance, productivity, cooperation, and workplace relationships. 

Drugs are broadly categorized as depressants, stimulants, or hallucinogens. Illicit drugs include but are not limited to cannabis, hashish, amphetamines, methamphetamines (ecstasy, ice), cocaine, opiates (opium, heroin), synthetic drugs, and LSD. 

Legal drugs include medications prescribed by registered health professionals and over-the-counter drugs. 

Many legal and illicit drugs can affect a person's capacity to carry out work duties safely, impairing judgment, coordination, motor control, reaction times, memory, concentration, mood, and perceptions. The combined effects of prescription drugs and alcohol can also impair work performance. 

Use of legal and illicit drugs and alcohol becomes a safety issue when a person's ability to exercise judgment, coordination, motor control, concentration, and alertness is affected, increasing injury or illness risk. 

Although legal, alcohol is an intoxicating agent found in beverage alcohol and in methyl and isopropyl alcohol. All forms of alcohol are considered safety concerns. 

This document is underpinned by Kmart's Code of Conduct and the alcohol and other drug testing in Supply Chain policy. It applies to drug and alcohol testing of individuals, voluntary alcohol testing units, and alcohol consumption on Kmart sites. 

It applies to Kmart team members (including managers and administration), contractors, labour hire employees, and visitors who have completed the Kmart safety induction and are aware of this policy. Cooperation with Kmart's safety efforts and adherence to workplace policies are required. 

If an employee is covered by an enterprise agreement, the relevant provisions within it shall apply in case of any inconsistency. 

This procedure document replaces any existing agreements, guidelines, practices, or understandings.

## Who does this apply to?

Adherence to Kmart's alcohol and drug testing policy and this document is a condition for entry to site for Kmart team members, contractors, visitors, and labour hire employees. Non-compliance or breaches may result in disciplinary actions, including termination of employment, cancellation of contractor agreements, or being turned away/not offered shifts. 

Labour hire employees are engaged by third-party agencies to work at Kmart sites. 

Contractors are individuals not employed by Kmart but performing work on site who have completed a contractor induction. 

Visitors include Kmart employees from other sites or support functions visiting a Distribution Centre. 

External visitors who do not work for Kmart, are not contractors, and have not undergone a contractor induction (such as mail deliverers, salespersons, government officials) are not covered by this policy, but are expected to be unaffected by drugs or alcohol and fit for work. Suspicion of substance influence will be handled separately and in conjunction with their employer. 

No person known to currently abuse, promote, or sell illegal drugs will be employed. 

What is an illegal drug?

Illegal drugs recognized as such under laws include but are not limited to cannabis/THC, heroin/opiates, amphetamines, methamphetamines, MDMA, cocaine, hallucinogens, hashish, synthetic drugs, depressants not prescribed by a physician, stimulants not prescribed by a physician, and abuse of prescription medication. 

Use or possession of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, or other controlled substances is prohibited on company premises. 

Kmart sites are drug-free workplaces, including carparks and off-site facilities managed by Kmart. 

Employees must not report to work or perform their duties under the influence of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, or other controlled substances. Any individual found non-negative for drugs or positive for alcohol will be deemed unfit for work, and appropriate action will be taken.

## Testing requirements

Testing for alcohol and drugs will be conducted at the discretion of an appointed Kmart Manager under the following circumstances: immediately following a serious safety incident or near miss involving plant or MHE, as part of regular random testing, or where there are reasonable grounds based on behavior or deteriorating performance.  

Kmart will bear all costs related to testing in these circumstances.

Drug and alcohol testing after an incident or near miss will occur immediately or as soon as practical. An incident is defined as one involving risk to safety, property damage, or involving plant or MHE. The individual involved must follow management instructions and participate in testing before leaving the site.

Random testing will be conducted regularly and at intervals determined by site management, generally targeting 7-10% of the workforce monthly. Testing covers all shifts and occurs at least once every three months per shift.

Reasonable suspicion arises when: an individual's behavior or demeanor is out of character; they are unable to perform duties safely; their productivity or attendance changes; physiological signs of drug or alcohol use are present; or there is credible information suggesting impairment. Anyone suspecting impairment must report this to a Kmart manager immediately.

When suspicion exists, the manager will seek approval to engage testing providers. The affected individual must comply with testing, cease work, and wait in a common area.

## Process for oral drug and alcohol testing

Oral drug testing is performed by trained staff using Australian/NZ Standards (AS/NZS 4760:2019). Testing screens for methamphetamines, amphetamines, opiates, oxycodone, cannabis/THC, cocaine, and other substances affecting fitness for work, including prescribed or over-the-counter medications used improperly. 

Qualified external providers using compliant devices will conduct testing. 

Selected individuals must provide proof of identity and supplementary personal information. All testing is confidential and conducted in private, away from the main workplace, unless the individual chooses a support person or management presence.

Prior to screening, individuals answer six questions about recent food, drink, alcohol, illegal drugs, prescribed medication, and over-the-counter drugs. 

A "yes" response to any question may lead to further clarification. Results are kept confidential. 

Individuals must sign consent for specimen collection and analysis, and results reporting.

## Refusal to test

Refusal to take or consent to testing is a serious breach. For employees, disciplinary action including termination may occur. For contractors, labour hire, or visitors, refusal may lead to being asked to leave the site and termination of services.

## Process for alcohol testing (self-testing)

Some sites provide a calibrated breathalyser in bathrooms or locker rooms for voluntary use before entering work. Employees or labour hire staff who suspect alcohol in their system should use this device.  

If BAC > 0.00%, they are considered unfit for work and must notify their manager immediately. The manager will advise on options: retesting until BAC is 0.00%, returning home, or not working that day. Employees may use paid entitlements if applicable.  

If BAC ≥ 0.04%, or if working machinery over 1.6 tonnes, the individual must stop work and retest until BAC is 0.00%, or go home.  

In New Zealand, alcohol measurement is in micrograms per litre of breath, with standard equivalents to BAC percentages explained.  

Individuals directed to go home must arrange transport and are not permitted to drive if BAC exceeds legal limits.  

Repeated positive self-tests (>2) in a 12-month period may lead to disciplinary action.  

If an individual starts work and then tests positive, they must cease work, wait in a designated area, and follow procedures for positive results.

Labour hire employees using the breathalyser will be reported to their employer if positive.

## Post screening process – Negative drug test result

If a drug test is negative, the individual and Kmart are advised immediately and the person returns to work. Results are documented and available upon request.

## Post screening process – Non-negative drug test result

A non-negative result prompts additional laboratory testing. The initial test does not confirm presence or concentration. Confirmatory testing involves secondary samples sealed with chain-of-custody procedures in the presence of the individual.

Samples are sent to an accredited laboratory, and results are returned within 48 hours. The individual cannot work during this process and will be stood down with pay until results are confirmed. 

If confirmed positive, disciplinary action up to termination is possible. Kmart will provide information about confidential drug counselling services.

All drug testing follows AS/NZS 4760:2019 procedures for collection and detection.

## Outcomes - Confirmed Positive Result to Drug or Alcohol Testing

For employees, a confirmed positive is a breach of the Code of Conduct. Disciplinary actions depend on the specifics:

If alcohol reading exceeds 0.00% but is less than 0.02% BAC, the employee will be suspended for their shift, may access paid entitlements, and must self-test before their next shift. Labour hire and other non-Kmart employees will be asked to leave and paid only for hours worked.

If alcohol reading is between 0.02% and 0.05% BAC, the employee will be suspended without pay and face disciplinary steps. Others will leave and only be paid for hours worked.

If alcohol exceeds 0.05% BAC, immediate suspension without pay and likely termination will follow, with others asked to leave.

If alcohol in those over 16 tonnes plant equipment exceeds 0.00% BAC, similar disciplinary measures apply.

For confirmed illicit drug use, the employee will be withdrawn from the roster with pay pending laboratory results. If positive, wages will cease, and termination proceedings may follow. Others will be asked to leave.

Breaches related to pharmaceutical or over-the-counter medications are not disciplinary if the medication use is disclosed and consistent with safe work practices.

## Consumption of Alcohol at Authorised Functions

Alcohol at work functions requires approval from senior management. Alcohol must be served responsibly, and individuals must not return to work until they are fit to do so.

Alcohol must not be available or offered in an unsupervised or excessive manner. Food and low alcohol beverages must accompany alcohol. The event must be supervised by management or approved caterers to control distribution, cease service at designated times, prevent underage service, and ensure safe return home.

## Education and Support

Kmart provides education and support through inductions, policy sessions, and informational materials.

Employees should seek clarification from their manager if unsure about responsibilities. Policies are available on KIT (intranet), with hard copies available from site administration.

## Team Member Assistance

Individuals must attend work fit for duty. Support is available through the Employee Assistance Program and other services.

Employees experiencing issues related to drugs or alcohol should consult their doctor, counseling services, EAP, or their manager. 

Participation in rehabilitation programs is encouraged and will not jeopardize employment if done voluntarily and satisfactorily.  

Employees will retain entitlements while participating in approved rehabilitation. 

Kmart may transfer affected employees to safer roles or suspend duty. 

## Confidentiality

Test results are confidential and only shared with involved parties. Results may be disclosed under legal requirements or disputes.

Records, testing processes, and outcomes are kept confidential. Access is limited to relevant parties.

## Record Keeping

All results are retained for seven years from the date of testing. Laboratory results are retained for three months. 

Results are available upon request from the testing provider.

## Disputes and grievances

Disputes or grievances should be addressed according to relevant enterprise agreements or Kmart policies, available on KIT or through management.
