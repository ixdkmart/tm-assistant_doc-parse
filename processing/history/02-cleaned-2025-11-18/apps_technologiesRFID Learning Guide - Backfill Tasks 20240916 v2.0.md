# Digital Backfill Tasks Learning Guide

Previously, backfill processes were manual and cumbersome, taking team members away from delivering outstanding customer service and enhancing the shopping experience.

With RFID and Tory, the process is different.

Tory performs a store run each morning to identify missing items by reading RFID tags. This alerts team members to pick these items within the Backfill Task on the RFID app to fill the floor.

# Finding Backfill Tasks

1. Sign into the RFID app.
2. The main screen appears after sign-in.
3. Click the 'Backfill' tile to access backfill tasks.
4. The loading data screen appears briefly before backfill tasks load.
5. Select a task from the list.
6. Tasks are divided by department and fixture type (cage or rail).

# Performing Backfill Tasks

1. After selecting a task, categories included within the task will be shown.
2. Select a category.
3. The backfill pick page displays product information such as a picture, department/class category, name, style code, and colour.
4. To locate the item, select "Show on map."
5. The item will appear as a green marker on the store map.
6. Zoom in on the map using two fingers or plus and minus signs.
7. Use the back button to return to the pick page.
8. Once all items are found, select the checkbox to confirm you have all items.
9. Click 'Confirm' to return to the category screen to select the next item.
10. If an item cannot be picked, the team member can attribute a reason by clicking the 'Unable to pick' button.

# Reason Codes

Cannot locate tag with hand wand: use for items that cannot be located after using the RFID hand wand.
Online/layby/click & collect bleed: use for items not locatable after RFID attempt.
MDU (Minimum Display Units): use for items that do not fit in their allocated space. A request should be made to the Digital Stores' Specialist team to reduce the MDU if needed.
Wall bleed: use when a backfill task was generated incorrectly for an item already on the shop floor, such as a menswear item from the shop floor back wall that was plotted in the stockroom.

# Completing Backfill Tasks

Once all available items have been backfilled, the task screen will be blank, with no more tasks to select.
