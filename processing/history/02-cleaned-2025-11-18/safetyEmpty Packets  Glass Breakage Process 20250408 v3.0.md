# Empty Packets & Glass Breakage Process

## Empty Packets

Empty packets are the packaging taken off products sold within Kmart, which are usually hidden or concealed within the store. They can be found in both obvious and hidden areas. Identifying empty packets indicates theft in a store. All store teams should be aware of hot spot areas for empty packets and know what to do if they find them. 

High-volume areas for empty packets include change rooms (behind mirrors, under fitting room seating), back of the bike units, shed area (home décor), cosmetics area, areas with little customer traffic, and back of house areas such as stock rooms and tea rooms.

Each store is different and will have different keycodes for identified empty packets. It is important to know the top empty packet keycodes in your store to create a stronger presence in those areas. This information is obtained from the number of empty packet adjustments under code 21.

To reduce empty packets, keep your team informed regularly on the results. Create a red route and encourage the team to walk these areas during shifts, breaks, or when leaving the store. Know your empty packet hotspot areas and encourage teams to frequent them. Report any suspicious items immediately to a manager. Know your store’s Persons of Interest (POI) and reach out to your Profit Protection Business Partner for assistance.

Empty packet bins should be set up in the back of house areas to allow team members to place identified empty packets into them. These bins are then accounted for and written off using adjustment code 21. Bins should be organized based on store layout, for example, by departments like Kids World, Clothing World, or Home World.

## Empty Packet Bin Signage

Stores should set up empty packet bins by world, with signage provided on each bin to clearly identify its designated world. Managers are responsible for reviewing and writing off the empty packets in their area using adjustment code 21. Signage is located on the kit at Store > Profit Protection > Tools.

## Managing Empty Packet Process

| Step | Actioned By | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | All Team Members | Identify an empty packet. Remove it from its location. |
| 2 | All Team Members | Take the empty packets to a manager and report where they were found, if anything suspicious was seen, the time of discovery, and provide the packets identified. | 
|   |   | It is important to give as much detail as possible to your manager for potential CCTV review. |
| 3 | Manager | Record the details provided by the team member and place the empty packets into the relevant world empty packet bins. |
| 4 | Manager | During team huddles, communicate high-volume empty packet locations to create awareness and encourage patrols of these areas. |
| 5 | Manager | Ensure empty packets are adjusted weekly using code 21, or daily in high-volume stores. |

## Scenario Resolutions

Empty packets identified in back-of-house areas should still be reported. Managers should consult their Profit Protection Business Partner if needed.

If a high-volume empty packet area has no cameras, contact your Profit Protection Business Partner for assistance.

If empty packet bins are full after one day, your store is classified as high-volume. Managers must write off these daily with adjustment code 21 and inform the Profit Protection Business Partner.

For high-volume empty packet areas, ensure your team is aware of these locations, discuss them at huddles, and encourage frequent patrols, including when taking breaks or leaving the store.

## Glass Breakages

Glass products often break in store and must be handled with extreme care to prevent injury. Breakages should be managed carefully and written off to maintain stock integrity.

All managers are responsible for ensuring the disposal process is followed and that each breakage is recorded on the Glass Breakages Bin Write Off Form.

## Glass Breakages Setup & Signage

Each store should have a glass breakage bin set up in the back of house area next to the empty packet bins. The bin should be no larger than 130 litres. Bins can be ordered from Blackwoods (code 03469520).

Glass bins must have the Glass Breakages signage attached. A copy of the Glass Breakages Bin Write Off Form should be placed on a clipboard and attached to the wall above the bin.

## Glass Breakages Process

| Step | Actions |
|---|---|
| 1 | Identify a broken glass product. Using cut-resistant safety gloves, carefully remove the glass and place it into the glass breakages bin. |
| 2 | Record the item on the glass breakages bin write off form, which is located on a clipboard above the bin. Glass bins are only for broken glass or sharp items. |
| 3 | All managers should review the contents and perform weekly write-offs. In high-volume stores, this should be done daily. |
| 4 | Once the items are written off, both team members must wear cut-resistant gloves and safety glasses and lift the bin using a two-person lift into the dumpster. |
|   | Never push down on the contents when placing broken glass into the bin, as this can cause injury. If the bin is full, ask the manager to organise an emptying. |

Important: If a product has missing items but remaining items are saleable, it should be sold as a soiled and damaged item. This applies to sets of glasses where one is broken but others are in saleable condition. Ensure there are no broken fragments in the box before sale.
