# RFID Printer Learning Guide

This guide outlines how to maintain the RFID printer. For information on how to print and tag items, please refer to the RFID Tagging Learning Guide.

## Void stickers - portable printer calibration

If VOID stickers are printed, the printer needs to be calibrated to debug the error and rectify the issue.

Press the 'Home' button to bring up the home menu.

Press 'OK' on the RFID screen.

Using the right arrow, press across to unveil the hidden option, RFID Calibrate.

Press 'Start' or 'OK' to recalibrate the printer.

It will display a confirmation message once complete before returning to the main menu.

After these steps are performed, you should be able to resume printing RFID labels for the tag up process.

## Void stickers - large printer calibration

If VOID stickers are printed, the printer needs to be calibrated to debug the error and rectify the issue.

Click 'Menu' on the touch screen.

Press the RFID icon from the top menu, second from the right.

Click the RFID tab that appears.

Confirm one label/RFID sticker feeds out by pressing the 'Feed' button below the screen.

Click 'RFID Calibrate.'

Click 'Start Calibration.'

Calibration can take 5 to 15 minutes. During this time, the printer will slowly take in the label completely and then produce the label again.

Once calibration is complete, click the tick (checkmark).

Then click the arrow back in the top left corner to return to the main menu.

## Large printer manual calibration continued

Reload the media, ribbon, and RFID label by opening the media door.

Close the print head.

Close media door A.

Click 'Calibrate.'

Click on the home icon to return to the home screen.

## Media out - replace large printer label roll continued

Place the new label roll on the media arm and pull out a length long enough to reach through the print head and the front of the printer.

Feed the length of the label roll you pulled out through the back or side of the print head.

Push the label roll up against the side of the printer and push the media supply guide up against the label roll.

Slide the print head media guide up against the label roll, ensuring the guide doesn't bend the label.

Ensure you do not touch the green laser light.

Close the print head assembly by rotating the lever towards the front of the printer. You must hear a click when the print head is closed.

Once the print head is closed, shut the media door. Ensure the light inside the media door is off to confirm it has closed correctly.

On the printer operator panel, un-pause the printer using the 'Pause' button.

The printer will perform a small calibration after starting up, indicated by a few stickers coming out. This ensures RFID encoding and label printing are aligned and working correctly.

## Ribbon out - replace large printer ink roll continued

Gently rotate the yellow handle on the used roll shaft clockwise until the clear part of the ink roll is wrapped under the blue tape.

Ensure the ribbon is flush against the head and in line with the RFID labels.

Close the print head assembly by rotating the lever towards the front of the printer. The metal lip should align with the middle of the labels.

Once the print head is closed, shut the media door and ensure the light inside the media door is off.

On the printer operator panel, un-pause the printer using the 'Pause' button.

The printer will perform a small calibration after startup, with a few stickers coming out.

## FAQ's and troubleshooting

If the 'media out' message appears after installing a new RFID sticker roll, double check the sticker roll and ribbon roll are threaded correctly. Ensure they are pushed back as far as possible on the spool. Confirm the head level is clicked close with a loud click. Close the printer door and check the light is off. Press 'Pause' to un-pause the printer. You should then be able to print.

To make the RFID tag print darker, click 'Menu', select the 'Print' icon, then choose 'Print Quality'. Change the darkness setting to 25 or more.

## Troubleshooting calibration and IP address

There should always be a small calibration when turning on the printer. To ensure this, go to 'Settings' or 'Favourites', change 'Power Up Action' to 'Calibrate', and restart the printer.

Similarly, when closing the lid, the printer should calibrate. Change 'Head Close Action' to 'Calibrate' in 'Settings' or 'Favourites'.

To find the printer IP address, click 'Printer Info' in the top right corner. The IP address will be under 'Active IP (WLAN)'.

If a triangle with an exclamation mark appears on the power pack screen, it indicates overload caused when the power pack has the power on but the AC power button is turned off. Unplug the printer, turn on the AC power, then plug the printer back in.

If the power pack shuts down after 4 to 5 hours, turn the power pack off and then on again to reset.
