# PDT(TC51) - SIP Softphone - User Guide

Within selected PDTs, a phone app will appear.

You can make phone calls using the app, just like with a Desk Phone or a DECT cordless phone.

When you first open the app, you will see a page that looks like a familiar phone app.

The dialing plan has changed from 3 digits to 7 digits.

When making an internal call to an EXT, you must prefix the store number before the EXT number.

For example, to call EXT 651 at store 1106 Cranbourne, dial 1106651.

This change applies to every EXT within the store, including PA EXT 155.

To identify which EXT number you are using, select the default user icon at the top right of the screen.

The screen will show the current EXT number, for example 1106 670.

You can also sign out of the EXT number from this page.
