# Hand Scan to Container Learning Guide

## Step 1
Open the RFID App and select 'Count Capture'.

## Step 2
Using the storage selector at the top of the screen, select which container you want to scan into. Choose either BOH for apparel fixtures (backfill will generate from the units captured into this storage), RCV/Decant for aged load, FB2's, footwear pallets, returns, etc. (backfill will not generate from the units captured into this storage), or FOH for capture areas on the shop floor that may have been missed. Only complete FOH scanning when directed by the DSS team.

## Step 3
To start scanning, press the trigger on the hand scanner once. The new tag count on the screen will show a live capture of the tags that have not been read by Tory on the most recent run. To stop or pause scanning, press the trigger again.

## Step 4
To save your progress in this container, press the finalise button. The count will reset to 0 for the next container.

## Step 5
Click 'Yes' to complete the count capture for this container.

## Step 6
Follow steps 2 to 5 for each subsequent container (BOH, RCV/Decant, FOH).

## Step 7
When all containers have been captured, return to the Home screen.

## Step 8
Select the 'Inventory Summary' tile.

## Step 9
Press the 'Save & Finalise' button. If the button is greyed out, please wait as all data may not have uploaded. Refresh and try again.

## Step 10
Press 'Yes, Continue' to confirm.

Backfill tasks should generate after approximately 10 minutes.

## Mode Switching for Hand Wand
When scanning BOH areas, there is an option to switch between 'far mode' and 'near mode'. Selecting 'far mode' allows the wand to capture more tags from a distance by maximising signal strength. It is recommended to switch to 'near mode' when scanning areas close to online containers or zones 1, 2, and 3 to avoid capturing tags from a distance incorrectly. Each time data is booked in, the mode will switch back to the original setting. A video demonstrating how to switch modes is available.
