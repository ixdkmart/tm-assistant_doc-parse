# Everseen Frequently Asked Questions

Everseen SCO Technology is a software program applied to self-serve machines. It detects when a customer has missed scanning a product or has left items in their basket and begins to complete the transaction. This is known as basket base loss. The following are frequently asked questions and answers about this system.

## Benefits

What are the benefits of having Everseen SCO technology?  
As Everseen detects missed scans and prompts customers to scan items, the benefits include a reduction in shrink, increased sales, team member time savings, improved customer experience through self-correction, and the ability for Kmart to monitor the SCO area for operational efficiency opportunities.

## Cameras

What is captured by the cameras at a SCO?  
The cameras record only instances where no scans, basket base loss, or abandoned transactions occur. The footage is stored within the Everseen dashboard for 30 days. For privacy, individuals’ heads are pixelated, and EFTPOS terminals are masked with a black box so PIN numbers cannot be shown.

What is the range of the cameras for Everseen? For example, will the cameras detect if a trolley is used and items are not scanned?  
Everseen technology only detects items on the SCO, including the side shelf, scanning bed, and bagging area. Efforts are underway to enhance functionality to accommodate trolleys.

Is there anything that can impact the use of cameras?  
Yes. Cameras must be kept clear for correct operation. Decorations such as Christmas and Halloween should not be placed on or around the cameras.

## Customer Engagement

What needs to be considered with customer service and Everseen?  
Every customer should receive great service and never be accused of wrongdoing. Missed scans can be accidental; each case should be treated the same. Follow the 5D's in threatening situations and notify your manager as soon as possible.

What has been the rate of CTS since Everseen went live?  
No CTS (Customer Troubleshooting System) instances have been reported. Everseen has been trialed in the Chadstone store in VIC for over 12 months without CTS occurrences. Monitoring continues.

If a customer questions the use of Everseen technology, what should I do?  
Call for a manager to assist. The manager will direct the customer to store signage and the entry to the SCO area. For privacy concerns, customers can contact the Kmart and Target Privacy Manager, whose contact details are on the signage.

## Everseen Dashboard

What is the Everseen Dashboard?  
It is a system where all store data is collected. It records interventions such as no scans. It reports how each intervention is responded to, including team member assistance. The dashboard stores footage of interventions, enabling the Profit Protection team to monitor responses and management.

How do I get access to the Everseen dashboard?  
Currently, only the Profit Protection team has access. Store access may be provided in 2024, with training prior to access.

## Getting the Best Results from Everseen Technology

What do I need to do to get the best results from Everseen?  
The system improves over time as AI recognises scanned products. Maintaining housekeeping in the SCO area and guiding customers to use the SCO correctly are essential. 

Maintaining the SCO Area:  
Ensure that any remaining products are collected and removed. Remove receipts, bags, and hangers from the SCO. Empty baskets or baskets with products left by customers should be cleared to prevent interference with the cameras.

Customer Assistance:  
Assist customers if they use the SCO backwards, helping them to move items correctly. Always assist with customer questions about the technology and direct them to signage. When unsure, ask a manager.

System Observations:  
Report any malfunctions to your manager and log issues through the IT Service Desk Portal.

## Help & Support

What should I do if I notice an issue with Everseen, such as videos not displaying or nudges not appearing?  
Contact the IT Service Desk. The team will coordinate with Everseen to resolve the issue promptly.

It is important to report any issues with Everseen or SCO equipment as soon as they are identified to facilitate a quick resolution.

## Media

Has Kmart prepared for media releases?  
Yes. The Corporate Affairs team has been involved during the Everseen project setup and is ready to respond to media inquiries.

## Other Retailers

How many retailers use Auror?  
Approximately 30,000 retailers internationally use Auror. In Australia, 10 major retailers currently use it.

Can Kmart see other retailers’ events or profiles, and vice versa?  
No. Kmart can only view its own events and profiles. Kmart does not share information with other retailers. This is a Wesfarmers decision, and any change will be communicated to stores.

## Product Switch

If a customer is buying a $30 pair of shoes but swaps the barcode with a $1.50 item, will an intervention still be recognized?  
This functionality, known as product switch, is still under development. It is not yet performing as required. Everseen and IT teams are working on solutions, with an aim to introduce it in early 2024.

## Reporting

Will there be reporting for Everseen?  
Yes. One week after going live, you will receive an email report. Reports will include weekly no scan volumes, estimated no scan value (based on an average cost of $5 per no scan), weekly basket base loss, and weekly abandoned transactions. Work is underway with the Analytics team to create a dashboard, which will be communicated when available.

How can we keep the team informed of Everseen results?  
A results poster is available on Kit under Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen. It should be printed in colour, laminated, and updated weekly using the report sent each Monday.

## Signage

Is signage required to inform customers about Everseen?  
Yes. Signage must be placed at the store entry near the conditions of entry and at the SCO area. It ensures compliance and supports store audits. The signage is available on Kit (Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen).

## Training

What training is available for Everseen?  
An LMS course and a guide are available on Kit (Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen). All managers and team members working in SCOs must complete these training resources.
