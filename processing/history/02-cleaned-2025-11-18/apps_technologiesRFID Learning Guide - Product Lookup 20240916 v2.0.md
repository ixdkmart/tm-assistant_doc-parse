# Product lookup function
The RFID app helps you check inventory quickly and easily to see if there is a tag.  
If you need to find an item, you can use the "Show on Map" feature to locate the product in the back of house or on the shop floor.

# Using the RFID app to check inventory
Log into the RFID app.  
Select the 'Product Lookup' option from the main screen.  
To find the right item, either scan the barcode or enter details using keycode, description, or style ID.  
If you enter search details, click on the magnifying glass to bring up the item.

Once you've scanned the barcode, the item will appear.  
Select the 'Show on Map' link in the bottom left corner to bring up the location map.  
The items will show on the map as green tags.  
Zoom in on the map using the "+" and "-" buttons or with your fingers, similar to zooming on your phone.
