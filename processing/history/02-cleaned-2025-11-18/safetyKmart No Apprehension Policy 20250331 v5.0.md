# Kmart No Apprehension Policy

This policy outlines the procedures and standards for dealing with an incident of shop theft in Kmart stores. External theft and shop stealing are common issues that retailers deal with daily. The process of identifying, apprehending, and arresting shoplifters is time-consuming, dangerous, and costly.

## No Apprehension Policy Purpose & Application

Policy purpose: To ensure no Team Members or Managers apprehend or accuse a person of wrongdoing regardless of circumstances. All incidents must be reported to managers who log them into the Solvsafety Profit Protection Incident form via Kit.

Policy application: This policy applies to all Kmart Team Members.

Country application: Australia and New Zealand.

## No Apprehension Policy

Under no circumstances are any Kmart Team Members authorized to apprehend, arrest, seize, hold, restrain, or detain any person where there is an allegation that the person has stolen, regardless of the reason or circumstances. This includes locking the individual in a room to prevent them from leaving or requesting them to return to the store.

Under no circumstances are any Team Members to accuse a person of wrongdoing regardless of the circumstances. If someone has left the store with unpaid goods, record the time and relevant details, and report the incident to the line manager to log into the Solvsafety Profit Protection incident report form via the Quick links section on Kit.

No one should chase, follow, or try to stop a shoplifter exiting the store. The Don't be a Hero (5D's process) must be adhered to.
