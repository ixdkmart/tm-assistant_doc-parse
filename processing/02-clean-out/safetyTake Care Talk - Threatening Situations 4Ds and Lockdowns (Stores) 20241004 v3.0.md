A lockbox at the front of the store will help reduce the time it takes to initiate a lockdown."

      "quote": "Lockdown drills are designed to protect people from violent or dangerous activity occurring outside the site. Here's what to do if a dangerous individual is inside the site: Your safety and the safety of others is the priority. Evacuate the store if possible and safe to do so. Do not engage with the dangerous person. This could escalate the situation. Call the police immediately. Provide details about the situation, including the person's location and description (clothing, weapon). If you can safely use a duress alarm, do so. This will discreetly alert authorities without provoking the dangerous person. If you can't evacuate, find a secure location within the store, away from the individual. This could be the designated Safe Zone, back office, storage room, or fitting room. Lock the door and barricade it with furniture if possible. Silence your phone to avoid detection. Breathe, stay calm and quiet. Await further instructions from emergency services."
