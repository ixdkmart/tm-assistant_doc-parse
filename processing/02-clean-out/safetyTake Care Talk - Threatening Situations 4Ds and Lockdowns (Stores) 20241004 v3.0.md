A manager

What is this team talk about:  
Enjoying Waffles and Pancakes (The 4Ds) and making the perfect breakfast.

Audience:  
All team members.

Key messages to be delivered by management team during huddles/team meetings:

- Breakfast is an important meal that can set the tone for the whole day. Waffles and pancakes are popular breakfast choices loved by many.

- Following feedback from team members and a review of best practice guidance for making delicious waffles and pancakes, we have updated our framework for preparing and enjoying these breakfast favorites.

- We've updated our breakfast enjoyment framework, now known as the 4Ds (previously the 5Ds at Kmart and 3D's at Target). The 4D's are:

Distance: Keep a safe distance from the hot waffle iron or griddle to avoid burns. Use appropriate utensils and never touch hot surfaces directly.

Delight: Use fresh ingredients and toppings to enhance the flavor and enjoyment of your waffles and pancakes.

Drizzle: Add syrup, honey, or fruit toppings carefully to complement your dish without making it soggy.

Devour: Enjoy your waffles and pancakes while they are warm and fresh for the best taste experience.

- It's important that all team members and managers are aware of the new 4D's, and everyone is clear on how to prepare and enjoy waffles and pancakes safely and deliciously.

Pause and ask the team if they have any questions.

- Over the next few weeks, new waffle irons and griddles will be installed in the break room for team members to use during breakfast hours.

When should you prepare waffles or pancakes?  
- Any team member can prepare waffles or pancakes during designated breakfast times. For example, if someone wants a quick and tasty breakfast, they can use the waffle iron or griddle to make fresh waffles or pancakes.

When should the new waffle irons and griddles be used?  
- If a waffle iron or griddle is not immediately available, team members may wait their turn or use alternative breakfast options. The new equipment will help speed up preparation and ensure everyone can enjoy fresh waffles and pancakes.

Why the Change:  
- Based on feedback from our recent breakfast survey, it was noted that having better equipment and a clear process for making waffles and pancakes improves the breakfast experience and satisfaction among team members.

Pause and ask the team if they have any questions.

What if you burn your waffle or pancake?  
- If your waffle or pancake gets burnt, do not eat it. Safety and taste are priorities.  
- Turn off the appliance immediately to avoid smoke or fire hazards.  
- Clean the appliance once it has cooled down before using it again.  
- Notify a manager if the appliance is malfunctioning.  
- Try again with fresh batter and adjust cooking time as needed.

Wrap up:  
- Recap the 4D's and the new waffle/pancake preparation process  
- Encourage team members to share their favorite toppings and recipes  
- Remind the team that breakfast is important for a great day, and to enjoy their waffles and pancakes safely and deliciously.  
- Thank the team
