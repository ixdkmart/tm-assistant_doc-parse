      "Testing for alcohol and drugs will be undertaken in the following circumstances at the discretion of an appointed Kmart Manager: immediately following a serious safety incident or near miss and anytime where plant equipment of MHE is involved; as part of random worksite testing; where there are reasonable grounds based on observations of behavior or deteriorating work performance by a Kmart Manager.",
      "If an incident or near miss occurs, drug and alcohol testing will take place immediately after or as soon as practical. The individual involved must follow instructions of Kmart management and participate in testing prior to leaving the site.",
      "Random drug and oral alcohol testing will take place on site regularly and at intervals/frequencies as determined by Kmart site management, generally testing 7-10% of workforce monthly across all shifts.",
      "Where there is reasonable suspicion that a person is affected by drugs or alcohol, a Kmart Manager will report this concern and seek approval to engage Kmart's drug and alcohol testing provider. The individual must comply and participate in testing, ceasing work and waiting in a common area.",
      "Oral drug testing is carried out by trained staff using Australian/NZ Standards (AS/NZS 4760:2019). Drug classes screened include methamphetamines, amphetamines, opiates, oxycodone, cannabis/THC, cocaine, and other substances affecting fitness for work.",
      "Individuals selected for testing must provide proof of identity and answer six pre-screening questions regarding recent food, drink, alcohol, drug use, and medication.",
      "Individuals undergoing testing sign consent for specimen collection, analysis, and release of results to Kmart or authorized representatives.",
      "Self-testing for alcohol using calibrated breathalysers is available at some sites prior to shift commencement. If BAC >0.00%, individuals must notify their Line Manager and follow directions based on BAC level, including retesting or going home.",
      "If a Kmart team member refuses to take or consent to testing, it is considered a serious breach and disciplinary action including removal from site or termination may occur.",
      "Post screening, negative drug test results allow immediate return to work; non-negative results require further laboratory testing with chain of custody procedures and possible stand down with pay until results are confirmed.",
      "Confirmed positive results lead to disciplinary actions based on alcohol levels or drug presence, including suspension, withdrawal from roster, or termination for Kmart employees; labour hire employees and contractors may be removed from site.",
      "Individuals taking prescribed or over-the-counter medication that may affect performance must notify Kmart and may need to provide medical certificates. Kmart may assess fitness for work and adjust duties or stand down individuals as needed.",
      "Alcohol consumption at authorised functions must be approved, supervised, and controlled to prevent excessive consumption and ensure compliance with policies before returning to work.",
      "Kmart provides education, support, and assistance programs including Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for team members with drug or alcohol misuse issues.",
      "Confidentiality of test results and processes is strictly maintained, with limited disclosure only under specific circumstances.",
      "Records of test results are retained for seven years; laboratory retains samples for three months.",
      "Disputes or grievances related to testing are handled according to relevant enterprise agreements or Kmart policies."

    "bestPractice": [
      "Use qualified independent and external service providers compliant with Australian and New Zealand Standards for drug and breath testing.",

      "Provide ongoing education and support through inductions, policy sessions, and accessible documentation.",
      "Assist team members with drug or alcohol problems through confidential Employee Assistance Programs and encourage seeking medical or counselling support."

    "caveats": [
      "Self-testing breathalyser is not available when an employee is required to undergo testing due to incidents or reasonable suspicion.",
      "Individuals must not drive themselves home if BAC is above legal limits; Kmart management will assist in arranging alternative transport.",
      "Disciplinary action is mitigated if individuals disclose prescribed medication use prior to testing and medication corresponds to detected substances.",
      "New Zealand breathalyser measurements use micrograms per litre of breath, not BAC percentage; equivalences are provided."
    ],
    "constraints": [
      "Individuals must cooperate with testing and related workplace policies; refusal results in disciplinary action or removal from site.",
      "Testing is at the discretion of appointed Kmart Managers based on defined circumstances.",
      "Random testing percentages and frequencies are determined by site management without minimum or maximum limits.",
      "Individuals must provide proof of identity and answer screening questions prior to testing."

    "troubleshooting": [
      "If an individual has a non-negative drug test, they may provide comments to testing staff and undergo further laboratory testing with chain of custody procedures.",
      "If a team member believes medication affected test results, they should notify testing staff and may leave workplace to obtain supporting medical information.",
      "Disputes or grievances related to testing results or procedures are managed through enterprise agreements or Kmart policies."

    "metrics": [
      "Random testing aims to cover 7-10% of the total workforce population each month.",

      "Alcohol BAC thresholds for disciplinary actions: >0.00 and <0.02%, 0.02% to 0.05%, >0.05%.",
      "New Zealand BAC equivalents: 0.05% BAC = 250 mcg/l breath, 0.02% BAC = 100 mcg/l breath, 0.04% BAC = 200 mcg/l breath.",
