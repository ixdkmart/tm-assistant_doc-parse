# A message from Health, Safety & Wellbeing

Breastfeeding welcome here.
It's not just inclusion, it's the law.
In Australian Federal Law, breastfeeding is a right, not a privilege.
Under the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984 it is illegal in Australia to discriminate against a person either directly or indirectly on the grounds of breastfeeding.
This means, a woman has the right to breastfeed, or express milk, anywhere she chooses.
This includes our stores.

## What to do

Seek help from your Store Manager if you are unsure.
No one should ever be asked by a team member to cover themselves or stop breastfeeding or expressing anywhere in our stores.
This includes in fitting rooms or on the shop floor.

## What to do if you receive a complaint

Sometimes, other customers will take offence to seeing a mother breastfeeding or expressing in one of our stores.
If you receive a complaint from a customer you may advise them that this is a women's right under Australian Federal Law.
If you are uncomfortable, unsure, or if the complaint escalates seek help from your Store Manager.
