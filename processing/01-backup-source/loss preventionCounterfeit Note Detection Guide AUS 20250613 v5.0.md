Counterfeit Note Detection Guide (AUS)

Counterfeit notes are an illegal imitation of a currency. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud. This guide provides information on the security features of the two types of Australian Notes to help identify if a note is genuine or counterfeit.

If You Identify a Counterfeit Note
Step 1: Contact your manager immediately.
Step 2: Do not handle the note.
Step 3: Report the incident to your Profit Protection Business Partner and email your state police. If state police choose not to conduct an investigation, complete the AFP Suspect Banknote Submission Form and send to the address listed at the bottom of the form.
Step 4: Record the incident via Auror.

Top Tips to Identify Counterfeit Notes
There are 2 types of Australian currency notes with slightly different security features, First Polymer Series Notes and New Polymer Series Notes. Here are the top tips to identify a counterfeit note for the two types:

First Polymer Series Notes
Check: What is it made of?
A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner and/or lighter than a genuine banknote.
Scrunch the note in your hand.

Test: A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched up.
Feel the distinctive texture of the dark printing.

Touch: The slightly raised print can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and numerals.

Look: At the window.
Check that the security features in the window cannot be easily rubbed off.

Hold: Hold to the light to view the shadow images.
When a genuine banknote is held up to the light, the Australian Coat of Arms should be visible under the print

New Polymer Series Notes
Check: What is it made of?
A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner and/or lighter than a genuine banknote.
Scrunch the note in your hand.

Test: A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched up.
Feel the distinctive texture of the dark printing.

Touch: The slightly raised print can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and numerals.

Look: At the window.
Look for an image in a small clear window. The image is embossed with a light and dark effect.

Tilt: Tilt the banknote to see
• A 3D image with a colourful border that appears raised.
• See a number change direction within the building
• See colours change within a bird.

List of Security Features - First Polymer Series Notes

Polymer Substrate
The plastic that Australian banknotes are printed on gives them a distinctive feel. A suspect banknote may feel thicker, thinner and/or lighter than a genuine banknote.
Most counterfeits are printed on paper and can be easily torn. It is difficult to start a tear along the edge of a genuine banknote. A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched up.

Clear Window
The clear window should be an integral part of the banknote and not an addition. Check that the white image printed on the window cannot be easily rubbed off. Look for the embossing (there is a wave pattern in the window of the $10 banknote, and the value of the banknote in the windows of $20, $50 and $100 banknotes). There is no embossing in the window of the $5 banknote.

See-Through Registration Device
Diamond-shaped patterns are printed inside a circle on both sides of a banknote. When a genuine banknote is held up to the light, the patterns should line up perfectly to form a seven-pointed star within the circle.

Shadow Image
When a genuine banknote is held up to the light, the Australian Coat of Arms should be visible under the print. This 'shadow image' is created by variations in the background printing on the plastic substrate.

Intaglio Print
Intaglio is raised dark printing with a distinct feel. On genuine Australian banknotes, the slightly raised print can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and other major design elements.

Background Print (Offset)
Multi-coloured and multi-directional fine-line patterns appear on each side of the banknote. This background printing should be very sharp. Check for irregularities such as less clearly defined patterns, thicker or thinner lines, or colour differences.

Microprinting
Tiny, clearly defined words are printed in the top left corner of the $5 banknote, and near the portraits on the other denominations. Most people need the help of a magnifying glass to read the microprinting. Most banknotes have their denomination microprinted in words (e.g. 'FIFTY DOLLARS'), but the $10 banknote has poems by AB 'Banjo' Paterson and Dame Mary Gilmore microprinted on it.

List of Security Features - New Polymer Series Notes

Polymer Substrate
Australian banknotes are printed on polymer, a type of plastic, and they have a distinctive feel. A genuine banknote should return to shape after it is scrunched up.

Top-to-Bottom Window
The window should be an integral part of the banknote and not an addition. Check that the security features in the window cannot be easily rubbed off.

3D Image
Tilt the banknote to see a three-dimensional image with a colourful border. The image will appear raised or recessed.

Flying Bird
Tilt the banknote to see a bird move its wings and change colour in the top-to-bottom window.

Colourful Bird
Tilt the banknote to see colours change within a bird.

Reversing Number
Tilt the banknote to see a number change direction within the building. The number alternately appears forwards, disappears, then appears backwards.

Rolling Colour Effect
Tilt the banknote to see a rolling colour effect. On one side of the banknote it is a prominent patch near the top corner; on the other side it is within a bird shape.

Image in Small Window
Look for an image in a small clear window. The image is embossed and has a light and dark effect. The window should be an integral part of the banknote and not an addition.

Intaglio Print
Feel the distinctive texture of the dark printing. The slightly raised print can be felt by running a finger across the portraits and numerals.

Background Print (Offset)
Multi-coloured and multi-directional fine-line patterns appear on each side of the banknote. This background printing should be very sharp. Check for irregularities such as less clearly defined patterns, thicker or thinner lines, or colour differences.

Microprint
There is microprint, or tiny, clearly defined text, in multiple locations on the banknote.
