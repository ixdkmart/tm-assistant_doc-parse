Ongoing Tag Management
Learning Guide

Having RFID tags on products allows Tory to count and locate stock.
If there isn't a tag on the product, the item can't be counted or located.
Being able to locate and count stock ensures we have a better inventory accuracy (SOH) and makes it easier when we need to find items for our customers.

Service desk process
• Attach laminated A5 signage to a tote/container at the service desk
• Service Desk TM to place any items requiring a RFID kimble tag in this tote/container
• AGPTS Manager to ensure these items are taken to the fitting room or tag at the service desk, allowing sufficient time to process before the next Tory run

Fitting room process
• Attach laminated A5 signage to a tote/container at the fitting room
• All stock missing RFID and kimble tags to be placed in this tote/container

• Print and display the 'Missing RFID tags' poster at the fitting room
• Before the end of each day, print and apply RFID tag (and kimble tag if required) to each item, ready for Tory's next run

NOTE: team members must have completed the relevant Digital Stores training to print RFID tags
