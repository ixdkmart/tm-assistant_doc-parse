Soiled & Damaged Clearance End Tips

It's important to review all soiled and damaged (S&D) stock daily and markdown the price of these products wherever possible, to avoid shrinkage. This guide steps through tips for managing S&D products. Please also note that clearance end setups as outlined in this guide are mandatory in all stores.

S&D Products That CANNOT be Sold
✕ Returned undergarments e.g., underwear, lingerie, swimwear.
✕ Apparel that is stained or damaged e.g., a tear in the material, chemical marks, sweat, body fluids/markings or used.
✕ Faulty, returned or display electrical products.
✕ Products missing the safety &/or compliance warning information labels.
✕ Products containing sharp or dangerous parts/substances, including broken glass.
✕ Products deemed unsafe to sell as they have missing parts or parts are damaged.
✕ Products in breach health & safety regulations e.g., open cosmetics/grocery items.
✕ Toys where the damage poses a choking hazard or risk of injury.

S&D Clearance Markdown Criteria & Schedule
When a product is safe to be resold under soiled and damaged, items can be marked down as per the RLO assessment process.

S&D Markdown | Percentage Off | Time Between Markdown
The first S&D markdown | 50% off the original sell price | When identified as S&D product
The second S&D markdown | 50% off the previous markdown price | 2 days after 1st markdown
Additional S&D markdown* | 50% off the previous markdown price | 2 days after 2nd markdown
If product doesn't sell | Scan into salvage bin in RLO assessment (NZ stores write off under RLO)
