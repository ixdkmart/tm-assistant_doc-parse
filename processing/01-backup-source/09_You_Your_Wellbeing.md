Click on each of the cards below to learn more about each type.</p><p><strong>Hazard</strong></p><p>A hazard can be physical or emotional and is any situation that has the potential to cause injury, harm a person’s mental health, or damage property. E.g broken glass or a blocked emergency exit</p><p><strong>Near miss</strong></p><p>A near miss is an incident has occurred; however the person was not injured and/or property damage did not occur. E.g  a person has slipped on a spilled drink but not injured themselves.</p><p><strong>Incident / Injury</strong></p><p>An incident has occurred which resulted in an injury and/or property damage.</p><p><strong>Non-work related</strong></p><p>A Non Work Related (NWR) injury/illness is when a person has sustained an injury/illness that has not occurred in the workplace.</p><p><strong>Important to remember:</strong></p><p>All incident types must be reported by speaking to your manager immediately (within 24 hours of occurring) so corrective actions and/or injury management can be applied to prevent the incident from occurring again. This includes non-work related injuries as this helps your manager support you and plan for safety at work.</p><p><strong>The Wellbeing notice board</strong></p><p>Select the number to learn more about the information on the Wellbeing notice board:</p><ol><li>Not all hazards at work are physical, some can affect how we feel. These are called psychosocial hazards, and they could include things like feeling overwhelmed, unsupported, or dealing with tension at work. These situations can impact your mental wellbeing, just like physical injuries affect your body.</li><li>If an element of work is impacting your health, talk to a manager or someone you feel comfortable with. Remember you can also reach out to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) for free and confidential professional support.</li><li>You’ll also find helpful tips and activities on the Wellbeing calendar, available on the Wellbeing noticeboard.</li></ol><p>Let's move on to a quick quiz to test your understanding.</p><p><em>Section 3 of 4</em></p><p><strong>Knowledge check</strong></p><p>Before finishing this module, complete a quick knowledge check to explore your understanding of the <strong>You - Your wellbeing </strong>module.</p><p>Pass mark for this quiz is <strong>80%, </strong>so you need to get 4 out of 5 questions correct.</p><p><strong><em>Question</em>01/05</strong></p><p>What does a hazard report include?</p><p>Only physical dangers</p><p>Correctly unselected</p><p>Any situation that could cause harm, including emotional risks</p><p>Correctly selected</p><p>Only incidents that caused damage</p><p>Correctly unselected</p><p>Only customer complaints</p><p>Correctly unselected</p><p><strong>Correct</strong></p><p>Hazards include both physical and emotional risks, anything that could cause injury, affect mental health, or damage property.</p><p><strong><em>Question</em>02/05</strong></p><p>Which of the following is NOT a type of incident report?</p><p>Hazard</p><p>Correctly unselected</p><p>Near miss</p><p>Correctly unselected</p><p>Incident/Injury</p><p>Correctly unselected</p><p>Safety Simon’s checklist</p><p>Correctly selected</p><p><strong>Correct</strong></p><p>Safety Simon is our guide, but not a report type.
