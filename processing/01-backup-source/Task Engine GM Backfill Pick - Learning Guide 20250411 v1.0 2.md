7. Once the fixture location has been accepted, scan the barcode of the first item in the location. Work from left to right, top to bottom.

Scanned Product Information:

- Fixture location currently in progress
- The "In Progress" tab shows the most recently scanned product info
- The "Take" number is the minimum quantity that should be picked of this product. If 0, scan the next item.
- The location/s that this product is scanned into on the shopfloor and in the stockroom
- Keyboard to type in an APN or keycode if the barcode cannot be scanned
- If you are picking the last one of this keycode, ensure this is selected to also scan this keycode out of this fixture location
