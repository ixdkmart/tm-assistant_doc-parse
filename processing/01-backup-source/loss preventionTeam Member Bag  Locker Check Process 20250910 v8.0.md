Team Member Bag & Locker Check Process

This process has been created to develop a culture of security awareness, to assist in the prevention of Team Member dishonesty and applies to all Kmart employees in Australia and New Zealand (includes Store and National Office Team Members), as per the conditions of employment.

At Kmart, we acknowledge that our Team Members are hardworking and honest. Each Team Member is recruited because of these qualities. Unfortunately, there have been occasions where some Team Members do not abide by the same code of conduct. This may see some Team Members steal from the business, which could present as the following:

• Taking, using, or eating merchandise without paying for it
• Taking cash from cash registers

To ensure that we uphold our business practices, this process outlines the expectations of all Kmart Team Members (includes Store and National Office Team Members), to present their bag/s that are of A4 in size or larger, when exiting a store on all occasions, conduct a security check.

Team Member Bag Check Conditions

• Please note that in Tasmania, only Team Members above the age of 18 are permitted to conduct bag checks.
• To develop a culture of security awareness, it is the expectation that all Kmart Team Members exiting a store on any occasion and from all exit points, are required to present their bag/s and contents prior to leaving, to allow a Team Member or Manager to conduct a security check.
Examples of leaving a store where bag/s checks are required include:
   o The end of a shift or store visit; and
   o Leaving the store during a break.
• Team Members are required to present their bag/s, to a Team Member or Manager, prior to exiting the store, by opening segments of their bag/s for a security check to be conducted, for any bags that are A4 in size or larger.

Kmart Team Members and Managers must ensure that the following is adhered to when conducting a security check of a Team Members bag/s:

• The Team Member or Manager checking the bag has been trained on how to conduct a bag check.
• The check is completed in full view of a CCTV camera.
• The Team Member or Manager conducting the bag check must not interfere with the contents of the bag and must request the Team Member move the items themselves for a clearer view.
• Security guards are also permitted to conduct a bag check.

Team Member Bag Check Process

Step | Action
-----|--------
Step 1 | The Team Member leaving the store approaches the Customer Greeter or a Manager with their bag and opens to show the contents.
Step 2 | The customer greeter or manager reviews the contents of the bag (viewing only).
Step 3 | If contents of the bag are blocking the view, the customer greeter or manager may ask the Team Member if they can move the item.
Step 4 | Once the bag is checked the Team Member can continue to leave the store.
Info | We want to develop a culture where Team Members voluntarily present their bag upon leaving the store.

Team Member Bag & Locker Check Process

Team Member Locker Check Process
Step | Action

Kmart is entitled to conduct routine security checks of lockers used by team members. Individual security checks of lockers will not take place unless the team member:
• is present; or
• has given permission, on each occasion, for the search to take place in their absence.

Step 1
Where a search or check takes place in the team member's absence, the team member may nominate another team member to be present.

This will not apply in emergency situations or where there is a risk to health and safety. Where a search of a team member's bag, parcel and/or locker has taken place without the team members permission or presence, they will be notified within three (3) business days.

IT Equipment

Kmart loses a large volume of IT devices weekly due to team members leaving devices in lockers or taking them home. These include:
• Push to Talk devices
• PDT's
• Body Cameras
Team members are not to leave these devices in their lockers and devices must be handed back at the end of the shift so they can be charger and ready for use. If a team member accidentally takes a device home, please ensure it is returned to the store as soon as possible.
