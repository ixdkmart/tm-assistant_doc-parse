Everseen Frequently Asked Questions

Cameras

Question: What is captured by the cameras at a SCO?
Response: Only instances where no scans, basket base loss and abandoned transactions occur. These recordings are stored within the Everseen dashboard for 30 days. Footage of any individuals head is pixelated for privacy reasons, and EFTPOS terminals are masked with a black box, so pin numbers cannot be shown.

Question: What is the range of the cameras for Everseen? For example, will the cameras detect if a trolley is used, and items are not scanned?
Response: The Everseen technology only detects items on the SCO (side shelf, scanning bed and bagging area). We are looking into added functionality of Everseen and what we can do to accommodate trolleys.

Question: Is there anything that can impact the use of cameras?
Response: Yes. It's important that the cameras are always kept clear so the Everseen system can worked correctly. Decorations such as Christmas and Halloween should not be placed on or around the cameras.

Customer Engagement

Question: What needs to be considered with customer service and Everseen?
Response: It is important that every customer is provided with great service and is never accused of any wrongdoing. Missed scans can be accidental and each case should be treated the same.
Always remember to follow the 5D's if faced with a threatening situation and notify your manager as soon as possible.

Question: What has been the rate of CTS since the Everseen has gone live.
Response: No CTS has been reported. We have been trialling this in the Chadstone store in VIC for over 12 months and didn't get any instances of CTS. We are however monitoring this.

Question: If a customer questions the use of the Everseen technology, what should I do?
Response: Team Members should call for a manager to assist. Managers can then direct the customer to the signage placed at the front of the store and entry to the SCO area. If the customer has concerns over privacy, they can contact the Kmart and Target Privacy Manager (contact details are on the Everseen signage).

Everseen Dashboard

Question: What is the Everseen Dashboard?
Response: The Everseen dashboard is where all the data collected for each store. It records each intervention such as no scans, and also reports on how each intervention is responded to, including instances where team members need to assist with interventions.
The dashboard also stores all the footage from these interventions. It allows the Profit Protection team to monitor interventions, as well as how team members respond to and manage their interventions.

Question: How do I get access to the Everseen dashboard?
Response: Only the Profit Protection team have access to the Everseen dashboard at this stage. We will look at providing stores with access in 2024, which will be implemented with training prior to access.

Everseen Frequently Asked Questions

Getting the Best Results from Everseen Technology

Question: What do I need to do to get the best results from Everseen?

Response:
The Everseen technology will improve over time as the system AI begins to recognise products scanned. It is important that housekeeping of the SCO area is maintained, and customer are guided to use the SCO area correctly for the technology to perform to a high standard. These include:

Maintaining the SCO Area:
• Make sure that any products left at a SCO are collected and removed from the area.
• Make sure there are no receipts, bags and hangers left on the SCOs as the cameras may pick these up.
• Remove empty baskets or baskets left with products still in them left by customers to ensure the cameras don't pick these up in the next transaction.

Customer Assistance:
• If you see a customer using the SCO backwards (placing items on the bagging area and scanned to the other side), assist them and let them know they need to place the items on the other side (and help move the items for them).
• Always assist when a customer asks about the technology and direct them to the Everseen signage for more information. If your unsure always ask a manager for help.

System Observations:
• If you notice the Everseen technology not working the way it should, talk to your manager and log the issue through the IT Service Desk Portal.

Help & Support

Question: If I notice an issue with Everseen e.g., videos not showing, nudges not appearing. What do I do?
Response: Contact the IT Service desk and the team will work with Everseen to resolve the issue.

***It's important that any issues with Everseen or SCO equipment is reported as soon as it is identified so a resolution can be provided as soon as possible.

Media

Question: Has Kmart prepared for any media releases?
Response: Yes, we have been in contact with the Corporate Affairs team through the setup of the Everseen project, and the team are ready for responses if a media release occurs.

Everseen Frequently Asked Questions

Other Retailers
Question | Response
How many retailers use Auror? | 30,000 retailers use Auror internationally, and there are currently 10 major retailers using it in Australia.
Can Kmart see other retailer events/profiles, and vice versa? | No. Kmart can only see events and profiles from within Kmart, and Kmart does not share any information with other retailers. This is a decision made by Wesfarmers, however if this changes, we will notify stores.

Product Switch
Question | Response
If a customer was buying a $30 pair of shoes but was barcode swapping with say a $1.50 pair of things would an intervention still be recognised. | Not yet. This function is called product switch, which we are still working on with testing as it's not quiet performing the way we need it to. Everseen and our IT teams are working on finding solutions to get this feature working the way it should and hope to introduce it in early 2024.

Reporting
Question | Response
Will we get reporting for Everseen results? | Yes, the week after you go live with Everseen you will receive an email with reporting. Reporting will start as an excel spreadsheet with tabs that report on the following:
• Weekly no scan volumes (how many no scans occurred on all SCOs per store).
• Weekly no scan value (applying an average cost price of $5 per no scan multiplied by the total number of no scans for all SCOs per store).
• Weekly BBL (how many basket base loss were recorded on all SCOs per store).
• Weekly abandoned transactions (how many transactions were not completed for all SCOs by store).
We are working with the Analytics team to create a dashboard, and will advise when this is available and how to access.

How can we keep the team informed of the Everseen results? | We have created a results poster located on Kit > Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen. Print in colour, laminate and use a white board marker to update using the Everseen report provided each Monday via email.

Signage
Question | Response
Do we need signage to inform customers of the use of the Everseen technology? | Yes, it is critical that every store places the signage located on Kit (Stores > Loss Prevention > Everseen) at the entry near the conditions of entry signage and also the entry to your SCO area. This is required to ensure your store meets compliance standards. The audit team have this noted on audits and will check stores to ensure this requirement is met and maintained.
