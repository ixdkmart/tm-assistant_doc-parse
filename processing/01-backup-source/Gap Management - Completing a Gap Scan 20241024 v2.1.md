Inventory Management
Gap Management: Completing a Gap Scan

Why
Completing Gap Scans ensures:
• We maintain stock on hand (SOH) integrity
• Out of stock (OOS) items are ordered or replenished so they are available for our customers.

Who
Managers or authorised team members.

When
Scan all empty labelled product locations at least once per week.
• Includes clearance/allocation and advertised products.

How
• Find a PDT
• Get access to a portable printer
• Follow the steps below

Safety
• Rotate hand/trigger finger regularly when using PDT
• Use a safety step when working above shoulder height or below waist height

PROCESS
[10 numbered steps with detailed instructions]

1. ACCESS THE MANAGEMENT OPTION FROM THE MAIN MENU, SELECT A GAP SCAN

2. ENSURE A PRINTER IS AVAILABLE. SELECT 'Y' THEN SELECT THE PRINTER NUMBER.

3. SCAN THE SHELF LABEL ON THE NEXT EMPTY ITEM LOCATION.

4. THE EDD DATE HAS BEEN REACHED OR HAS PASSED.

5. IF A DIFFERENT SCREEN APPEARS, FOLLOW THE STEPS IN RESPONDING TO OTHER MESSAGES.

6. IF FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED, FOLLOW THE STEPS IN SPECIAL PROCESS 1.

7. ENTER 'Y' TO CONFIRM OR 'N' TO CANCEL THE ADJUSTMENT.

8. YOU WILL NEED ONE TO COVER EACH SHELF EDGE LABEL FOR THE ITEM.

9. REPEAT STEPS 3 TO 8 UNTIL ALL GAPS HAVE BEEN SCANNED.

RESPONDING TO OTHER MESSAGES

CHECK THE MESSAGE SHOWN ON THE PDT.
MATCH IT TO ONE OF THE SCREENS SHOWN HERE AND FOLLOW THE STEPS.

MESSAGE: 'ITEM IN STOCKROOM'
- Sometimes the empty item will be scanned into the stockroom.

COUNT THE NUMBER OF UNITS NEEDED TO FILL THE ITEM
[Numeric keypad shown with numbers 1-15]
"I'LL NEED 15 UNITS TO FILL THIS"

MESSAGE: 'ITEM AUTOMATICALLY FLAGGED FOR INVESTIGATION'
- Due to their value, some items can't be adjusted without further investigation. Return to step 3.

MESSAGE: 'REMOVE LABEL'
- Sometimes an item may no longer be ranged or sequenced.
- So we can remove the label and use the space for another item.
- The PDT will ask which location the label is being removed from.
- Scan the location label so that the item is no longer associated with that side or end.

MESSAGE: 'INSERT OOS LABEL'
- If the SOH value is already 0, OOS labels can be inserted. Return to step 7.
- You will need one to cover each shelf edge label for the item.

SPECIAL PROCESSES
I. ITEM INVESTIGATION
- Press ENTER to send the item to the SOH integrity function
- Enter 'Y' to confirm or 'N' to cancel. Return to step 3.
