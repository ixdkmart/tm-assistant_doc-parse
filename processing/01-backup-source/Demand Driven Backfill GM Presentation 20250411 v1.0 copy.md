Agile delivery

[The image shows two graphs comparing Traditional delivery vs Agile delivery approaches]

Traditional delivery:
- Single horizontal line showing "Solution scoped, designed and developed" followed by a vertical bar for "Full launch"
- Value plotted against time

Agile delivery:
- Stepped approach showing incremental progress:
  1. Solution scoped, designed and developed
  2. Proof of concept launched
  3. Pilot launch
  4. Extended pilot
  5. Full launch
  6. Additional Functionality (multiple steps)
- Each step incorporates user feedback
- Value increases incrementally over time

Key Benefits (shown with icons):
1. Early access and use of the tool
2. Early and frequent opportunities for feedback to adapt the solution
3. Ability to influence the priority of the next functionality built
4. Improved team satisfaction and productivity

• Wall bleed reduction

[Right section - Mobile app interface]
• Identification of a recall/withdrawal from sale
• Near time reporting through the Manager portal
• Sound alerts for clearance, not on show or no sales in 30 days

## Page 6

Why are we changing?

We have an inconsistent approach to backfill completion across stores, with a huge opportunity in reducing waste in the process

• Focus on 100% completion of all fixtures each week

• Order determined by store team's preference with minimal data backing decisions

• Timing of fixtures picked impacts volume coming out

• Congestion in BOH affects other processes throughout store

Maintain or improve sales by using data driven prioritisation (right fixture, right time)

How value is unlocked

[A circular diagram showing interconnected elements around a central lock icon with a dollar sign. The following elements are connected by arrows radiating from the center:]

• Fixtures prioritised by logic - right stock, right time

• Increased volume coming out of stockrooms

• Decrease in BOH congestion

• Non-value fixtures removed from workload

• Less fixtures scanned across for the week

• Productivity increase in backfill pick and sequence pack away

• New logic saves managers time choosing which fixture to pick

## Page 9

Demand Driven Backfill

Daily fixture prioritisation, removing non-value fixtures
using a dynamic logic to determine the % of total locations to pick each week

[Four key elements presented with icons:]

1. Prioritise the most valuable fixtures
based on the right stock, right time

2. Pick the maximum amount of stock productively

3. Identify fixtures to repeat weekly, to maximise stock availability and sales

4. Average completion of 70% of total fixtures, saving REM and driving sales

## Page 10

How will backfill change?

• Prioritisation and thresholds introduced

• Fixtures provided daily via task engine on PDT

• Stores will only complete the same (repeat) fixture if value is identified

• Stores are required to complete 100% of fixtures generated each day

• No longer a need to complete 100% of total stockroom fixtures

• Compliance is measured daily on the number of fixtures generated vs what is completed

• Additional fixtures cannot be added

• Reporting in Power BI - replaces paper-based reporting long term

• Near time reporting coming soon in the Manager Portal

## Page 11

What's not changing?

• No change to the way take qty's is calculated.

• Scanning all keycode's in the fixture remains the same process.

• Manifesting on time plays a part in what take qty's are required.

• SMS is calculated by what is scanned vs what is expected.

• Scanning away overstocks resets the take qty's of keycodes to zero.

• 8900 - 8999 fixtures won't generate backfill tasks.

## Page 12

Introduction of prioritisation logic and thresholds

CURRENT state
All picked on a Monday
7001 | 7002 | 7003 | 7004 | 7005 | 7006 | 7007 | 7008 | 7009

FUTURE state example
MON | WED | MON | N/A | FRI | TUE | WED | THUR | N/A
7001 | 7002 | 7003 | 7004 | 7005 | 7006 | 7007 | 7008 | 7009

• Targets the right locations at the right time, maximising the volume of stock coming out

• Results in more cages being produced, driving stock to the floor at the right time and improving availability for customers

N/A = non-value fixtures not required to backfill for that week

## Page 13

Non-priority fixtures

WEEK 1-4:
FIXTURE 8003
[Red X icon]
Fixture not done

Note: "Fixture Not Done in last 4 weeks"

WEEK 5:
FIXTURE 8003
[Green checkmark icon]
Fixture added to priority list regardless of priority

Key Information:
• All fixtures will be backfilled over a rolling 5-week period
• It's expected less than 5% of fixtures make it to week 5
• Fixtures not scanned within 28 days will automatically be added to week 5 to maintain SMS integrity

Repeat fixtures

[Three identical warehouse shelf images shown with different icons below]

1. [Green checkmark icon]
Fixture completed this week

2. [Dollar sign icon]
Monitor fixture score, if above threshold will be provided for repeat

3. [Circular arrows icon]
Fixture will be added to priority list the following day

[Note: Images show storage shelves with boxes arranged on three levels, with "> Score" text between the second and third shelf units]

## Page 15

Workload planning

1. After 3 weeks a baseline trend for the average number of fixtures to be completed each day will be identified, allowing stores to create a new base roster

2. Number of fixtures to be completed for the week will be available every Monday, through the power bi report

3. Review the daily task list and allocate the team members fixtures,
• Tasks are sorted numerically with task cards displaying the world and department
• Ability to filter by world for easy task allocation and completion

4. Fixtures not completed on the prescribed day will be recalculated and reprioritised for the next day
Repeat fixtures may be added each day, including weekends

5. If tasks are not completed during the week, additional fixtures will be generated the following week

[Two blue circular indicators showing:]
- Prescribed fixtures must be completed Mon - Sun
- 20% of Prescribed fixtures given each weekday

## Page 16

Backfill task completion

• All GM backfill tasks are created daily between 4.00am – 5.00am (local time)

• Fixtures provided daily via task engine on PDT

• Each fixture will have its own task card. Team members will use the GM backfill pick filter then select the task card

• Complete only prescribed fixtures, cannot complete additional

• Stores will only complete the same (repeat) fixture if value is identified

• Location refresh is still available, this will add value to fixtures the following day

• Shop floor backfill function still available

• Stockroom scan in/out is still available

• Current backfill function will be disabled

Task compliance

Compliance is measured daily on the number of fixtures generated vs what is completed

Stores are required to complete 100% of fixtures generated each day

Store - 9999 [Table data]
Monday: 20 fixtures generated, 20 completed, 100% compliance, 0 carry over
Tuesday: 20 fixtures generated, 20 completed, 100% compliance, 0 carry over
Wednesday: 20 fixtures generated, 10 completed, 50% compliance, 10 carry over
Thursday: 30 fixtures generated, 30 completed, 100% compliance, 0 carry over
Friday: 20 fixtures generated, 5 completed, 25% compliance, 15 carry over
Saturday: 15 fixtures generated, 15 completed, 100% compliance, 0 carry over
Sunday: 4 fixtures generated, 4 completed, 100% compliance, 0 carry over

Total: 104 completed, 80.6% compliance, 0 carry over

Weekend completion/compliance is required during pilot

Reporting

Power BI reporting available

Paper-based reporting phased out

[The image shows three main components:
1. A Power BI icon with text indicating Power BI reporting is available
2. A "no paper" icon indicating paper-based reporting is being phased out
3. Two dashboard screenshots showing reporting interfaces with various metrics, charts, and progress reports, with one marked as "COMING SOON"]

## Page 19

When priority logic works best

• Stockroom keycodes are scanned in
- Will increase the priority of the fixture. If stock is not scanned in correctly the value of the fixture is not at its full potential.

• BOH fixture sortation is set to lean standards
- If fixtures are neat and tidy products can be scanned efficiently also driving high SMS integrity

• Multi-located keycodes are kept to under 5%
- When the same product is located together not over multiple fixtures, the value of the fixture increases and there is a higher chance the right quantity will be filled to the shop floor.

• Location refresh is maintained as per store task tool
- Refreshes the quantity required to be filled adding to the value of the fixture, driving stock out of the stockroom.

• Gap scan is completed as per store task tool
