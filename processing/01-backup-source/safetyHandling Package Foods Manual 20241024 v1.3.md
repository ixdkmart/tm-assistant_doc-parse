Introduction

Empty Packets and Soiled and Damaged Write offs

The following allows all empty packets and soiled and damaged write offs to be processed through the PDE unit.

The entry of empty packets and soiled and damaged items through the PDE unit will account for these items as a stock adjustment.

Stores will be able to view the stock adjustments via the MR Screen 05 under the following stock adjustment descriptions:
• Empty Packets
• Soiled and Damaged Write Off's.

The write off quantity of an item will be reflected on the Stock Replenishment report if the item is registered against a stockroom fixture in the Stockroom Management System (SMS).

As the information is processed through the PDE unit, the data is batched and:
• available for store reporting, that is by department (at keycode or summary level), by write off type for a selected period of time
• sent to the accounts system to be reported on store and business STR reports.

What to do with spoilt products

Food products require special treatment to ensure they are in optimum condition for consumer consumption.

These processes give details on specific opportunities to look out for and what to do when they arise. Following these processes it will help to ensure that waste is kept to a minimum.

Inevitably, some food products will have to be thrown out for various reasons. When throwing out food products batch them together with all other merchandise that need to be written off.

⚠ Process as above to be followed for write off's.

What to do about customer complaints

Document any customer complaints on a Customer Complaint—Faulty Merchandise form and send it to the Customer Relations Department, National Office. Enclose the defective product with the form.

10 May 2006                                                                                                                     Kmart    1

Processing Empty Packets and Soiled and Damaged items using a PDE

Empty Packets
As stores complete recovery and presentation throughout the store, empty packets are collected and sent to the Repairs and Returns room.

Empty packets may include Apparel tags (where there exists reasonable suspicion of garment theft) and empty packets from the General Merchandise side of the selling area.

Soiled and Damaged
The majority of merchandise that is damaged to the point where it cannot be sold is sent to the CRC, via the RLO system. Stock status is automatically adjusted when the file is transmitted to National Office.

However, there is selected merchandise that cannot be transported to the CRC. This merchandise, if unsaleable, has to be written off at store level, to ensure accuracy of stock status.

Using the PDE Unit
The PDE main menu includes an option titled Shrinkage.

Access to the Shrinkage section will only be available to the store management and administration staff (users that possess either a XXXXM or XXXXA user ID, XXXX being your store number).

Where?
From the PDE Unit Main Menu.

Why?
Processing empty packets and write offs via the PDE unit.

Empty Packets and Soiled and Damaged Reports

Introduction
There are reports available relating to the empty packets and soiled and damaged process.

The data on the reports is subject to the criterion that is selected when setting up the report.

You have the option to print reports for:
• Either or both empty packets and write offs
• A single department or all departments
• Date range, that is a single day, for a week or up to 6 weeks (this is the limit of history held by the system)
• All keycodes (known as details) or totalled by type at departmental level (known as summary).

Mandatory reporting
It is mandatory though, that each Monday morning two reports are printed for the previous week.

These reports are:
• Empty Packets and Write Offs in detail for all departments
• Empty Packets and Write Offs in summary for all departments.

These reports are reviewed and signed by the store manager.

They are filed in the applicable period box for 12 months.

Cleanliness

Introduction
Health Department regulations in Australia state that all food storage areas (packaged or otherwise) must be kept clean. The following are of particular concern.

Presentation
Presenting a clean, fresh, well ticketed selling area for consumable products is key to influencing the customer's decision to purchase food and build a loyalty to the product. To ensure stores maximise sales, profit, and customer satisfaction:
• Check for open or broken packets at least daily and dust and clean shelves at least once a week
• Immediately clear away any spilt food products
• Check stock rotation, move stock with the closest use by dates to the front or top and place fresh stock at the rear or bottom
• Separate any stock with 4 weeks or less shelf life remaining, they should be reduced to clear, refer to 'Managing Short Coded Merchandise' on page 28.
• Process any stock that has passed its use by date via the soiled and damaged process
• Ensure all food products are displayed and stored off the floor
• Ensure checkouts and their food displays are part of the daily presentation routines.

Spilt food products
Spilt food harbours mould and bacteria will attract pests such as rats and flies. It also encourages the growth of weevils.

What to do
• immediately clean up spilt food or drink
• record and throw out broken or open packets.

Dirt and debris on packaging
Dirt and dust on packaging can encourage more rapid spoilage of the food when opened and can adversely affect the appearance of the product.

What to do
Clean up any build-up of dust, mud or debris that may soil packages and ultimately find its way into the food when the package is opened.

10 May 2006                                                                                                                  Kmart    7

## Page 14

Handling Packaged Foods

Pests
Moths can perforate some types of packaging and lay eggs in the food, which hatch into weevils. Rats and mice can also chew through packaging and contaminate products with saliva or droppings. Birds, which gain entry into, and nest inside storerooms, can leave bird droppings on food packages.

Rough handling can cause tiny holes and tears in packaging, which can allow pest's access to food.

What to do
• ensure that pests such as flies, moths, cockroaches, rats and mice are eradicated
• entry to be made in the Pest Control book for action by the contracted Pest Control company
• consult a pest control company to devise the most effective eradication program if any sign of infestation is noticed. Store should contact Kmart Maintenance Centre to seal any possible points of entry; for example, any cracks, gaps or holes
• if baits are laid for cockroaches or rodents, eliminate any possible contact between them and the food
• net bags of nuts, birdseed and fish food are potential sources of weevils or moths, so ensure that there is distance between these products and food intended for human consumption.

Weevils are one of the most common pests encountered in Kmart stores. For detailed information about how to control weevils, refer to 'Weevil control' on page 23.

Garbage disposal areas

What to do
Locate bins well away from food storage areas. Empty and clean them regularly.

In the receiving area

Handling
Rough treatment of pallets or outers of food products can damage unit packets and result in:
• loss of product from broken packets
• soiling of intact packets, storage areas and displays by the contents of broken packets
• contamination and deterioration of the food; for example, stale food, loss of gas, unpleasant flavours, growth of bacteria and mould, infestation by weevils, maggots and the like.

Damage and denting to cans of soft drink is a particular hazard. This can cause tiny cracks in the lacquer coating on the inside of the can and allow the acid in the drink to attack the aluminium. The can is weakened as a result, making an explosion more likely.

What to do
• Check deliveries of food products with obvious damage and isolate affected stock
• Do not put any damaged food products on display. Instead, document the damage and notify the buyer
• Handle all food products with care.

⚠ If you notice leakage from pallets or outer cartons of liquid products, such as soft drinks or fruit juices, locate, record and throw out the leaking container immediately to minimise the loss of remaining stock and write off through the PDE. Notify the buyer if the product was damaged prior to Kmart receiving it.

10 May 2006                                                                                                    Kmart    11

Handling Packaged Foods

Temperature and moisture
Exposing packaged food products to high temperatures and moisture can spoil or degrade the products. This can result in changes in the appearance, flavour or character of the food or encourage growth of mould and bacteria. Some examples of this are:
• melting of chocolate, which results in white 'bloom' on chocolate products
• loss of carbonation in soft drinks
• uneven distribution of fat in biscuits
• flavour changes and rancidity in potato chips
• loss of sweetness in diet soft drinks
• sogginess in chips and biscuits
• chips and biscuits going stale.

What to do
Immediately clear deliveries of food products from the receiving area, particularly on hot, sunny or wet days.

Glass containers
Food products in glass containers will be contaminated by glass slivers if the container is chipped or broken.

What to do
Immediately record and throw out all food in broken glass packages. Notify the buyer if the product was damaged prior to Kmart receiving it. Raise a claim on GHPL or supplier depending on method of supply.

Checklist for the receiving area

Refer to the checklist below when handling packaged food in the receiving area.

Checklist:
□ Ensure the receiving area is kept clean at all times.
□ Inspect obviously damaged deliveries and isolate affected stock.
□ Handle all food products with care.
□ Record and throw out all:
• broken, dented and damaged packages
• soiled packages which cannot be adequately cleaned
• food spilt from broken packages
• food products showing obvious deterioration such as mould growth.
Notify the buyer if the product was damaged prior to Kmart receiving it.
□ Clear food deliveries quickly from the receiving area, particularly on hot or wet days.

Stockroom Management

Stockroom principles
When storing food in the stockroom the following points are to be followed to ensure all Business and Health Department regulations are met:
• All food products are to be stored off the floor on pallets or shelving
• Avoid making high stacks and do not stack heavier items on top of lighter or more fragile ones
• Any open or broken packaging should be removed from the fixtures and disposed of as per standard soiled and damaged process
• Follow any instructions provided by manufacturers or suppliers about the storage or handling of food items.
• Store food well away from highly perfumed products such as fragrances, toiletries, cleaning items, and other strong smelling products like fertiliser, motor oil and pool chemicals
• Store away from any areas prone to dampness
• Never store food products on the mezzanine level of stockrooms. Best place is on the ground level in a cool, dry area
• Avoid storing food products on west facing walls, under skylights or near heat generating equipment, for example refrigerators or air-conditioning units
• The use of off-site storage for food items should be avoided where possible. If off-site storage is used then the above points apply.

Stock rotation in the Stockroom
Stock rotation is the key to ongoing food freshness and quality. The simple rule is first in, first out.

What to do
• Check all date codes to determine the scheduled best before date of the product
• Date and rotate product where applicable when placing in the correct storage location
• Ensure that staff involved in restocking grocery and confectionery fixtures know how to read date codes so they can correctly rotate stock
• Check best before dates on all food products regularly (weekly is ideal) and always put packets with the closest best before date first.

10 May 2006                                                                                                                    Kmart    15

## Page 22

Handling Packaged Foods

Stock rotation in the Stockroom
(continued)

• Reduce the price of all food products with two weeks or less shelf life remaining by 50% to clear them
• All opened and unopened cartons are to have the number of the use by month, for example 8 for August, written in bold on the outer carton
• Rotate product where applicable when placing in the correct stockroom location
• Use items with the closest use by date first for filling
• Where a significant volume of an item with 8 weeks or less shelf life is identified the relevant manager should remove from fixtures and promote in store to drive sell through and avoid markdowns
• Where items have 4 weeks or less shelf life remaining then they should be reduced to clear, refer to 'Managing Short Coded Merchandise' on page 28.

⚠️ Once the best before date of any food product expires, put the stock aside and ring its respective supplier contact to arrange a credit via the red claim form. The supplier will then either take the stock back or request for it to be destroyed. Refer to 'Appendix 5 Supplier Contacts List' on page 49.

Stacking

⚠️ When storing food, it is important to remember that many food products or their packaging are fragile. In addition, Health Department regulations require food products to be stored off the floor.

What to do
• Avoid making high stacks and do not stack heavier items on top of lighter or more fragile ones
• Follow any instructions provided by manufacturers or suppliers about the storage or handling of food products
• Ensure all food products are stored on pallets or shelving.

Paints and chemical contamination

Food and food packages are very susceptible to picking up foreign taints and odours.

While most food packaging is designed to prevent outside odours from affecting the food inside, the packaging itself can pick up odours, which can considerably reduce the product's attractiveness.

Cleaning fluids, plant fertiliser and potting mix are potential sources of food contamination. Toxic fumes from pool chemicals and bacteria from blood and bone are some other obvious examples.

Stockroom Management

Paints and chemical contamination (continued)

What to do
Store highly perfumed products such as fragrances, toiletries, cleaning items and other strong smelling products, like fertilisers and motor oils, well away from food.

Moisture accumulation on products

Moisture can spoil dry food products.

Dry goods need to be stored in a clean, dry location to prevent absorption of moisture, for example from wet floors, and aid housekeeping and pest control.

What to do
Store food products off the floor on either pallets or racking and well away from any areas prone to dampness.

Temperature

High temperatures have a detrimental effect on most foods. Refer to 'Temperature and moisture' on page 12, for more information.

Stores in warmer regions should be particularly aware of temperatures in the stockroom.

What to do
• Never store food products on the mezzanine level of stockrooms. The best place is on the ground floor, in a cool, dry area
• Avoid storing food products on west facing walls, under skylights or near heat generating equipment such as refrigerators or air conditioning units. This is especially important for temperature sensitive products such as diet soft drinks, confectionery and biscuits.

Off-site storage

Stores in remote and/or warm areas, or those which sell large volumes of stock, may need to consider the use of off-site storage. It is important that off-site storage areas store stock as you would in your own stockroom.

Stores in warm climates should use off-site storage for general merchandise rather than for food. This avoids temperature damage to the food during transportation to the store.

10 May 2006                                                                                                                  Kmart    17

Checklist for the stockroom
Refer to the checklist below when handling packaged food in the stockroom.

Checklist:
□ Keep food storage areas cool, clean, dry and free from pests, toxic items and garbage.

□ Store food items as far as possible from toxic, highly perfumed or strongly smelling stock.

□ Do not stack fragile foods too high or place heavy items on top of them.

□ Ensure all food products are stored on pallets or shelving so they are off the floor.

□ Ensure that stored stock is as fresh as possible. Select for sale, stock with the closest use-by date first and put at the front of a peg on shelf.

□ Follow any advice provided by a supplier for handling or storing their product.

On the shelf

Introduction
The following points influence the customer's decision to purchase the food and build a loyalty to the product.

Cleanliness
Cleanliness is critical on any surface used for displaying foods for sale. Dust, dead insects and spilt product on or around food give the impression that it is not fit to eat. Refer to 'Cleanliness' on page 7, as spilt product also acts as an attraction for bacteria, mould and pest.

What to do
• Schedule thorough cleaning of food display areas regularly and remove open or broken packets
• Check for open packets at least daily and dust or clean shelves at least once a week
• Immediately clear away any spilt food products.

Stock rotation and use-by dates
When replenishing fixtures and displays, move stock with the closest use-by dates to the front or top and place fresh stock at the rear or base.

Remember that most of your stock will be purchased from the shelves at, or just below, eye level. While replenishing, move older stock from the top and bottom shelves to the middle to encourage purchase.

Include off-location displays of food products, that is, displays of the same product which are away from the 'parent' area, in regular use-by date checks and stock rotation routines. For more information, refer to 'Stock rotation in the Stockroom' on page 15.

Peg displays
Food products which are intended to be displayed for sale hanging on pegs have specially designed packaging. This packaging supports the bag of product on the peg and reinforces the seal around the hole.

If a packet of food does not have a peg hole, do not punch a hole in the top seam—the seam is not designed for this. Punching a hole in the seam usually results in the bag being punctured, and as a result the contents inside become stale.

10 May 2006                                                                                                                Kmart    19

## Page 26

Handling Packaged Foods

Temperature control
Even when foods are displayed for sale, they can still be susceptible to temperature abuse, particularly from blasts of air from the store's heating system.

Ensuring the store's heating/air conditioning system is operating properly is the best way to guard against spoiling temperature sensitive foods.

Displaying food for sale
It is illegal for retailers to store or display food products on the floor.

What to do
Ensure all food products are displayed and stored off the ground.

Merchandising for quick sale
It is sometimes necessary to sell food merchandise quickly due to its best before date. Please ensure this product is merchandised in a high traffic location so the customers can see the % off discount.

What to do
Consider the following suggestions for merchandising food products for quick sale:
• Place the product on gondola ends or around the checkout area
• Display the product in high traffic areas such as the front of the store or midway
• Have a side-walk sale outside the store or in the shopping centre
• Use the red light/clearance trolley.

Checklist for food on shelves

Refer to the checklist below when handling packaged food stored on shelves.

Checklist
□ Keep all food display areas cool, clean and free of dust and debris through regular scheduled inspections.
□ Check regularly for broken or open packets and spilt food.
□ Put oldest stock at the front or top when restocking fixtures and displays. Transfer stock from top and bottom shelves to the middle shelves.
□ Separate standard food products with a shelf life of two weeks or less remaining, mark down 50% then ring the respective supplier to arrange a credit. If no credit available, markdown further to clear.
□ Check use-by dates on all stock regularly and record, destroy and throw out any products, which have passed their use-by dates.
□ Store or display all food products off the floor.
□ Merchandise excess stock or short use-by date food products to encourage quick sale.

At the checkout

Cleanliness and stock rotation
As with all other areas of the store, clean checkouts reinforce the quality food image of our stores.

The principles of stock rotation also apply here. For more information. Refer to 'Stock rotation in the Stockroom' on page 15.

What to do
⚠️ Ensure checkouts and their displays of impulse food lines are included in regular cleaning routines.

Place the oldest stock on top of fresh stock for quick sale when restocking.

Handling
Gentle handling of food products by customer service operators is important, especially with fragile items such as biscuits and chips.

What to do
• Avoid dropping, crushing or tumbling fragile foods while searching for barcodes
• Apply care and thought when placing food purchases in carry bags; place heavy items in the bottom of the bag and light and/or fragile items at the top.

Checklist for the checkout
Refer to the checklist below when handling packages food at the checkouts.

✓ | Checklist
□ | Maintain the cleanliness and freshness of food stock at the checkout through regular cleaning and correct rotation of stock.
□ | Handle and package foods at the checkout with care to minimise damage to them.

## Page 29

Weevil control

What are weevils?
Weevils found in food are the larvae (grubs) of a few species of beetles and moths.

They grow from eggs laid by moths on the food and use the food to grow. The webs sometimes found on food infested with weevils are for the cocoon the weevil is preparing in order to turn into a moth (known as pupating).

Weevil moths have a life cycle of about 14 days. It should be remembered that a moth can lay a number of eggs and can come to maturity on one tenth of a gram of food, so even one moth can rapidly lead to an infestation.

What to do
⚠️ If moths are noticed in the stockroom or selling area, call in your pest control contractor to assess the likelihood of infestation and take appropriate action.

How do weevils get into food?
Weevils can:
• hatch from eggs present in the food before it was packed. This applies to foods which are not heated before packing
• chew through plant-based packaging such as paper and cellophane, or use small holes or tears in food packaging to lay their eggs on the food inside
• migrate from packaged food to surrounding products—food and non-food—and fixtures, particularly around the time they pupate.

What to do
If weevils are found on fixtures or non-food products, any food stored in the vicinity should be checked for infestation. It is also possible that food products previously held or displayed on that fixture have been infested so they too need to be checked.

If infestation is discovered, follow the procedures outlined in 'How can weevils be controlled?' on page 24. Contact your pest control contractor to assist with the eradication of weevils from the area.

10 May 2006                                                                                                                  Kmart    23

## Page 30

Handling Packaged Foods

Which foods are affected?
Ideal food sources for weevil growth undergo minimal processing and are low in moisture with a high nutritive value. Common examples are:
• dried fruits
• nuts
• coconut
• rolled oats
• chocolate/lollies
• dog food
• bird seed
• fish food.

Public health
Foods showing weevil infestation are regarded by public health authorities as being unfit for human consumption, and retailers who offer weevil infested food for sale and/or manufacturers of the infested food can be prosecuted.

How can weevils be controlled?
Controlling weevils in packaged foods sold by Kmart relies on two critical components:
• stock turnover
• good housekeeping.

The first, stock turnover, encourages the sale and consumption of food before any eggs, which might be present, can hatch.

The second, good housekeeping, ensures that there are no food sources, for example, spilt food remain, in the store which can encourage the proliferation of weevil moths and their subsequent attack on susceptible foods and/or food packaging.

Check all identical stock on show and in the stockroom for similar infestation.

If:
• weevils were brought to your attention by a customer returning goods, follow normal procedure for customer returns. Refer to 'What to do about customer complaints' on page 1, for more information
• an Environmental Health Officer (health inspector) visits the store as a result of a complaint about weevil infestation; comply with all instructions given to you by the officer. Also ask for a receipt for any confiscated product if you are not supplied with one.

## Page 31

Weevil control

How can weevils be controlled?
(continued)

Remove and count all identical stock with the same use-by dates as affected stock.

Isolate weevil infested stock in the stockroom by wrapping it in heavy plastic.

Notify the buyer if the product was infected prior to receipt.

Contact the (Kmart Maintenance Centre) KMC to arrange for your pest control contractor to visit the store:
• Do this within the next two days.
• The pest control contractor will provide advice and act on any sources of infestation that may be present.
• Notify Customer Relations Department.

Managing pet foods

Introduction
Pet foods, whether canned or dry, are relatively stable compared to other packaged foods; however, with their keen sense of smell, pets are very 'discerning' consumers—so freshness and appeal are important.

Dry pet food
Dry pet food usually contains a quantity of animal and vegetable oils, and it is the freshness of these oils, which determines the acceptability of the product to pets. Cats particularly do not like the smell of rancid oil and will refuse to eat food, which contains it.

Sunlight and high temperatures can accelerate the deterioration of these foods and weevil infestation of dry dog, cat and fish food and birdseed packets and bells can also occur.

Refer to:
• 'Stock rotation in the Stockroom' on page 15, for more information about how to avoid food deterioration
• 'Weevil control' on page 23.

Canned pet food
The most common problems with canned pet foods are associated with the tin in which they are sold.

The food is preserved by sealing it in the tin and pressure-cooking to sterilise it. For this reason, poor handling such as dropping, puncturing or slashing may break the seal and allow the food inside to spoil.

Sometimes, the coating on the inside of the can may be incomplete. This allows moisture in the pet food to attack the can and rust it through. Cans which are affected in this way are usually detected by a very unpleasant odour which indicates that pet food in the can is spoiling. The same thing can occur if the cans become wet on the outside.

26    Kmart    10 May 2006

## Page 33

Managing pet foods

Canned pet food (continued)
Very occasionally, you may notice that one or both ends of a can of pet food are swollen. This indicates that the food inside is spoiling, and may be caused by anything from poor handling to incorrect processing.

What to do
• Handle canned pet foods carefully
• Do not offer dented cans of pet food for sale because of the risk of food spoilage
• Advise National Office Buying Department 45 Grocery of the batch numbers (stamped on one end of the can) of any can of pet food which is rusted, split or swollen. Do not offer cans with these defects for sale.

Checklist for pet foods
Refer to the checklist below when handling pet foods.

✓ | Checklist
□ | Ensure correct stock rotation of dry pet food.
□ | Keep dry pet food away from high temperatures and moisture.
□ | Handle pet food products with care.

Managing Short Coded Merchandise

Date Coding
All consumable products as well as other selected merchandise have a Best Before, Use By, Sell By Date or Date of Manufacture.

Refer to 'Appendix 1—Stock Carrying A Date Code' on page 33 for a current listing of products.

Short Coded Merchandise
Where an item has 4 or less weeks till the Date Code it is classified as Short Coded merchandise. This does not mean that the total stock of a keycode is short coded but only the individual units that carry the relevant date.

When identified there are a number of options for managing this merchandise:
• Supplier may replace merchandise
• Supplier may offer full or partial credits
• Store to action markdowns to clear merchandise.

Supplier Credits or Replacement
Some suppliers will offer replacement stock for some or all of the short coded / expired stock or alternately offer full or partial credits.

Refer to 'Appendix 2—Supplier Credit Options' on page 39 for a list of suppliers who offer these options.

Where the above options are available they should always be used as an alternative to actioning markdowns.

Refer to 'Appendix 3—Decision Matrix' on page 45 for a Decision Matrix on how to handle the credits.

The decision matrix sets out the process to follow depending on the particular option that is offered by the supplier.

There are 9 different scenarios covered by the matrix. Included is the process for expired stock—either replaced or credit issued, stock nearing expiry—either replaced or credit issued and part credits, for example 1 for 2.

Read across the page for each scenario carefully to ensure the correct option is selected and followed to match the particular circumstance.

⚠ Where credit claims are raised under these circumstances, ensure the correct department keycode is used. The matrix includes the department keycodes for Dept 44 and 45.

Managing Short Coded Merchandise

Deciding when to Action a Markdown
A markdown on a consumable item should be initiated when:
• an item has a use by date of 4 weeks or less
• the supplier will not give a full credit or swap stock.

Always action markdowns as soon as required.

Markdown process
Initial markdown (1st markdown) is to be 30% of the current sell price.

Further markdowns are to be 50% of the previous markdown price. These markdowns should be actioned every week.

Markdowns are to continue every week until the product reaches its use by date then it should be written off at store level as Soiled and Damaged.

Kmart Business policy is that we will not sell any item that has exceeded its date code.

Refer to 'Actioning Short Coded Markdowns' on page 30.

Merchandise Markdown Consumable Items
Marked down consumables should be removed from the standard location and merchandised from a nominated specific high traffic area of the Store. Marked down consumables should always be in an off location area and not spread throughout the standard locations.

Consumables Markdown Register overview
All team members who action markdowns on any consumable items must first read this document then sign the Consumables Markdown Register.

The Consumables Markdown Register is then held at store level by Management as authority to action the relevant markdowns.

Refer to 'Consumables Markdown Register' on page 32.
