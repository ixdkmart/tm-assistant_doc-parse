EAS Hard Tag Reuse Process

Follow the below steps to return all EAS hard tags and pin sets for reuse by suppliers.
This process is for hard tags/pins only, and is not applicable to other Loss Prevention materials such as Spiderwraps, AutoPegs and Security Cases.

Step | Action

Step 1
Set-up a 'small online box' and place 1 x 'Security Tags Enclosed' sticker onto the side of the carton. If a 'small online box' cannot be sourced, then substitute for another box no greater than 30cm x 30cm x 30cm.

Note: It is important that these dimensions are adhered to, to comply with international transport requirements.

Step 2
At the registers/service desk/online processing area, after removing EAS hard tags, store the hard tags and pins together but do not connect the pin and sort these sets from spider-wraps, auto pegs, and other reusable tagging materials.
Tip: Register drawers can hold 2 x 10cm wide containers.

Step 3
Transfer EAS security tag sets (tag and pin) from service areas and place into prepared 30cm x 30cm x 30cm box. Continue this process until the box is full.
Once full, seal the box with tape.

Step 4
Place the box on top of the full hanger box, ensuring 'Security Tags Enclosed' sticker is facing outwards to be easily identifiable. Secure the box to the lid using tape to hold in place during transport.
