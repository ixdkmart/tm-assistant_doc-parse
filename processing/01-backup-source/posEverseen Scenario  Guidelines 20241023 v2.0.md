'Will Rescan' Everseen Intervention Scenarios

Scenario | Action Required by the SCO Team Member

A customer is holding 2 boxes of chocolates. They scan one box and hold onto the other. They don't scan the second box, and it triggers an intervention while they are holding the second box of chocolates. | Review the items scanned, watch the video and you will see only 1 box of chocolates has been scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the second box of chocolates placing them in the bagging area. Customer can now resume transaction.

A customer has attempted to scan an item that doesn't scan, and an intervention is triggered. | Review all items scanned, watch the video to identify the item not scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' to ensure the item that was not scanned is scanned correctly. Customer can now resume transaction.

A customer is holding 2 of the same products. They scan one, but place both into the bagging area. A no scan intervention occurs. | Review the items scanned, watch the video and you'll see only one of the two items has been scanned. Select 'Will Rescan' and scan the second item.

'No Rescan Required' Everseen Intervention Scenarios

Scenario | Action Required

A customer is shopping with their children and scans a bottle. One of the children grabs the bottle that has already been scanned and waves it around. This triggers a no scan intervention. | Review the items scanned, watch the video and you'll see the item has been scanned. Select 'No Rescan Required'. Customer can now resume transaction.

A customer leaves their mobile phone on the scanning bed of the SCO. This triggers a no scan intervention. | Review the items scanned, watch the video and you'll see all items have been scanned and the system is detecting the customer phone as a no scan. Select 'No Rescan Required'. Customer can now resume transaction.

A customer scans a large container and places in the bagging area. The container also has a lid, which is still in the staging area. The customer moves the lid after scanning the container. This triggers a no scan, as Everseen detects this as two products, when it is one product but two pieces. | Review the items scanned, watch the video and you'll see all items have been scanned and the system is detecting the container lid as a no scan. Select 'No Rescan Required'. Customer can now resume transaction.
