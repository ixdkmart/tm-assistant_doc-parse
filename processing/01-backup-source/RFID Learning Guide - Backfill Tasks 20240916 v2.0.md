Digital Backfill Tasks
Learning Guide

Previously, backfill processes were incredibly manual and cumbersome, taking Team Members away from what is most important, delivering outstanding customer service and enhancing the overall shopping experience.

But, with RFID and Tory it is a little different.

Tory performs a run of the store each morning during which Tory can see what items are missing, by reading RFID tags. This alerts Team Members to pick these exact items within the Backfill Task on the RFID app, to fill to the floor.

Finding backfill tasks

1. Sign into the RFID app
2. The main screen will appear after sign in
   • Click the 'Backfill' tile to access backfill tasks

3. The loading data screen will appear for a short period before the backfill tasks appear

4. Select a task from the list
   • Tasks are broken down based on department and the type of fixture you need to fill the items (cage or rail)

[The image shows screenshots of the RFID app interface displaying the home screen with various tiles including Count Capture, Product Lookup, Print, and Backfill, followed by a loading screen and a task list screen showing different departments and their corresponding numbers]
