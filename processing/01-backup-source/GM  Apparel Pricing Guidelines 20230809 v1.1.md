GM & Apparel Pricing Guidelines

The price of standard and seasonal merchandise (status 0, 4, 6) must not be reduced under any circumstances, unless soiled/damaged or nearing its best before/use by date. It is crucial that merchandise is sold at the price set by National Office to ensure profitability is maintained.

Merchandise Types by Status:
Status Type | Status # | Description
Clearance | 8 | End-of-life cycle merchandise managed by National Office.
Quit Cycle Clearance | 3 | Automated markdown for end-of-life cycle merchandise.
Standard | 0 | 365 merchandise.
Allocation | 4 | Seasonal, event and non-standard merchandise.
New Line | 6 | New 365 merchandise.

When merchandise moves to clearance or quit cycle (status 8, 3) stores are not permitted to further reduce the price on any product set by national office until they become oddments or end of range.

When this applies for General Merchandise (GM) End of Range:
When there are minimal units remaining of a clearance or quit cycle keycode and there is no longer adequate space for these on the selling area as replacement new lines have arrived.

When this applies for Apparel Merchandise Oddments/End of Range:
When there are three or less units remaining or a reduced size range (such as only three sizes or less available) of a particular style.

Steps for reducing prices for end of range:
1. Use a pathfinder or portable barcode printer to re-price the item, placing it over the existing barcode.
2. Do not reduce the price by more than 50% in the first instance.
3. Use a generic clearance shelf talker or flip ticket to highlight the new price.
4. Products should remain within the same location, on the original side (GM) or within the same pad on the back of a gondola (Apparel).
5. Continue to reduce prices on a weekly basis until sell through is achieved.
