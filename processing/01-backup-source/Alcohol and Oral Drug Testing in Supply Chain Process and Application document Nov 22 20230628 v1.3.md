Alcohol and Oral Drug Testing in Supply Chain - Process and Application

Introduction and Purpose

Kmart is responsible for ensuring it provides a safe workplace for its team members, contractors, and visitors.

Distribution Centre environments are hazardous due to work conducted at heights, the use of heavy machinery and mobile equipment, increasing the risk of serious injury or fatality.

Anyone in the workplace that has consumed illegal or illicit drugs and/or alcohol or is taking medication that affects their ability to work safely presents a safety risk, which may affect an individual's job performance, endanger lives, and potentially cause damage to Kmart property. Therefore, management of risks associated with the use of illegal or illicit drugs, medications and alcohol at work is essential to ensuring a safe work environment.

To protect the health and safety of all team members, contractors and visitors, Kmart is committed to taking all reasonable steps to ensure that all persons on site are unimpaired by drugs or alcohol at any site, managed by Kmart.

The Alcohol and other drug testing in Supply Chain policy, in addition to this document, which provides greater detail surrounding process and application, supports Kmart to:
• ensure a safe and productive working environment for everyone working or visiting a Kmart site.
• protects individuals and teams by reducing risk of incidents in the workplace.
• identify and address behavior not in line with our code of conduct, and
• improves work performance, productivity, cooperation, and workplace relationships.

Drugs can be broadly categorised as depressants, stimulants, or hallucinogens. Illicit drugs include but are not limited to cannabis, hashish, amphetamines, methamphetamines (ecstasy, ice), cocaine, opiates (opium, heroin), synthetic drugs and LSD.

Legal drugs include medications prescribed by registered health professionals as well as "over-the-counter" drugs.

Many drugs (legal and illicit), even in low doses, can affect a person's capacity to carry out their work duties safely. Drug use and alcohol consumption can impair judgement, coordination, motor control, reaction times, memory, concentration, and mood and can lead to distorted perception, confusion, restlessness, anxiety, panic and paranoia. The combined effects of prescribed and/or over the counter drugs and or alcohol can also affect a person's work performance.

The use of legal and illicit drugs and alcohol consumption becomes a safety issue when a person's ability to exercise judgement, coordination, motor control, concentration and alertness is affected at the workplace, leading to an increased risk of injury or illness to themselves or others.

Alcohol although legal, is an intoxicating agent. Alcohol is found in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol and in methyl and isopropyl alcohol. No matter how it is packaged or in what form alcohol is stored, utilised or found, it is considered alcohol and like drugs becomes a safety concern, heightening the risk of injury or illness.

This document is underpinned by Kmart's Code of Conduct and the alcohol and other drug testing in Supply Chain policy and applies to the drug and alcohol testing of individuals, voluntary alcohol testing units and the consumption of alcohol on sites managed by Kmart. It applies to Kmart team members (including managers and administration team), contractors, labour hire employees and visitors to Kmart Distribution Centre sites who have undertaken the Kmart safety induction and have been made aware of this policy. It is a requirement that individuals cooperate with Kmart in its efforts to comply with safety obligations and follow workplace policies and processes related to alcohol and other drugs in the workplace.

Where an employee is covered by the terms of an enterprise agreement, the relevant provisions within the applicable enterprise agreement shall apply to the extent of any inconsistency.

To clarify, this procedure document replaces any existing agreements, guidelines, practices, arrangements, understandings, or representations.

Who does this apply to?

Adherence, in its entirety, to Kmart's alcohol and other drug testing in Supply chain policy and this document is a condition of entry to site for Kmart team members (all Kmart employees), contractors, visitors and labour hire employees. Not complying or breaches to this policy may be considered a serious breach to the Kmart Code of Conduct, resulting in action up to and including termination of employment (Kmart Team Members), cancellation of contractor agreements (contractors) and being turned away or not being offered shifts at Kmart (labour hire employees).

Labour hire employees are defined as team members engaged by a third-party labour hire company to attend shifts and complete work for Kmart, at a Kmart site.

Contractors are individuals not employed by Kmart but perform work at a Kmart site on behalf of their employer and who have undergone a contractor induction.

A visitor to site, who would be required to adhere to this document and corresponding policy is a Kmart employee visiting a DC site from another site or working at that site periodically ie: store based employees, State leadership team or support functions.

Kmart's drug and alcohol policy does not apply to some external visitors, defined as individuals who do not work for Kmart, are not contractors or are not engaged as a Labour hire employee and have not undergone a contractor induction. An example of individuals who this may not apply to is a person delivering mail, a salesperson or a government authority. However, there is an expectation that anyone that attends a Kmart site (including external visitors), even for a short period of time, present unaffected by drugs or alcohol / fit for work. Therefore, instances where a visitor, not covered by Kmart policy, attends a Kmart site and there is a reasonable suspicion they are affected by drugs or alcohol, will be dealt with separately and in conjunction with the individual's employer.

No person will be employed who is known to currently abuse, promote or sell illegal drugs.

What is an illegal drug?

Illegal drugs are those substances recognised as a drug and/or defined as illegal under federal, state or local laws, including but not limited to:
• Marijuana / THC
• Heroin / Opiates
• Amphetamines & Meth Amphetamines
• MDMA
• Cocaine
• Hallucinogens
• Hashish
• Synthetic drugs
• Depressants not prescribed by physician for treatment of a current condition
• Stimulants not prescribed to the employee by physician for treatment of a current condition
• Abuse of prescription medication

Use or possession of alcohol, drugs, narcotics and other controlled substances

No team member, contractor, labour hire casual or visitor (internal or external) may possess drugs, narcotics or other controlled substances on company premises at any time. Kmart sites are a drug free workplace.

The possession, distribution and/or consumption of alcoholic beverages on company premises is prohibited.

Kmart premises extends to carparks and other off-site facilities managed by Kmart.

Employees under the influence of alcohol, narcotics, or other controlled substances

Kmart team members, contractors, visitors and labour hire casuals are prohibited from reporting to work or performing their job under the influence of alcohol, drugs, narcotics, or other controlled substances at any time. Kmart considers any individual who is non-negative for drugs and positive for alcohol, to be not meet fit for work requirements and action will be taken accordingly.

## Page 3

Testing requirements

Testing for alcohol and drugs will be undertaken in the following circumstances at the discretion of an appointed Kmart Manager:
• immediately following a serious safety incident or near miss and anytime where plant equipment of MHE is involved.
• as part of random worksite testing.
• where there are reasonable grounds based on observations of behavior or deteriorating work performance by a Kmart Manager.

Kmart will pay all costs relating to testing in accordance with this policy in the above circumstances.

Drug and alcohol testing proceeding a safety incident or near miss

If an incident or near miss occurs, drug and alcohol testing will take place immediately after or as soon as practical. An incident or near miss is whenever an incident (including a serious near miss or injury) has occurred which in the reasonable opinion of a Kmart Manager:
• involved a risk to the safety of the individual or others.
• damaged or had the potential to cause damage to property.
• involves any plant equipment or MHE.

The individual involved in the incident must follow the instructions of Kmart management and is required to participate in a drug and alcohol test prior to leaving the site.

Random drug and oral alcohol testing

Random drug and oral alcohol testing will take place on site regularly and at intervals / frequencies as determined by and at the discretion of Kmart site management.

The number of individuals randomly selected for oral drug and alcohol testing may vary at the discretion of Kmart site management and there is no minimum or maximum number of individuals that may be subjected to random testing on any given testing occasion. Generally speaking, Kmart is committed to testing 7-10% of the total workforce population each month via random selection. Random testing will be conducted on all shifts (AM, PM and night shift) and will occur at least once in a 3-month period for any particular shift.

Site Management (Distribution Centre Managers and Operations Manager) must ensure regular random drug testing is conducted on site and in accordance with this document.

Reasonable suspicion of a person being affected by drugs and or alcohol

Reasonable suspicion of a person being potentially affected by drug / alcohol use is where:
• an individual's observed behaviour / demeanour is out of character.
• there is an observed inability to perform their duties in a satisfactory or safe manner.
• there is a change to the individual's productivity and or attendance at work.
• there is notable physiological signs of drug and or alcohol use such as, but not limited to; unsteady on feet, smell of alcohol on breath, hyperactivity, bloodshot / dropping eyes, slurred speech.
• Kmart is provided with reasonable information that an individual may be affected by drugs or alcohol

Any individual at a Kmart site that believes someone is affected by drugs or alcohol is to report this to a Kmart manager immediately.

Where there is reasonable suspicion that a person is affected by drugs or alcohol a Kmart Manager will report this concern and seek approval from the DC Manager / site manager (or a Manager appointed to this role) to engage Kmart's drug and alcohol testing provider. Kmart People & Capability or Safety may be engaged for advice / support / assistance by either party. The individual identified as being potentially affected by drugs or alcohol must comply with this request by participating in the testing. While waiting for drug and alcohol testing to occur, the individual will be asked to cease work and remain in a common area such as a meeting room.

## Page 4

Process for oral drug and alcohol testing

Oral drug testing / screening is carried out by trained testing staff using Australian / NZ Standards for drug testing. The saliva (oral) drug testing is Standard AS/NZS 4760:2019 Procedure for specimen collection and the detection and quantification of drugs in oral fluid (Table 1 - Laboratory Immunoassay Screening Test Cut-Off Concentrations)

Drug testing will screen for the following classes of drugs:
• Methamphetamines
• Amphetamines
• Opiates
• Oxycodone
• Cannabis / THC
• Cocaine
• Any other substance that may alter a person's fitness for work e.g., Prescription medication not being used as per prescribed guidelines for a condition requiring current treatment

Kmart will only use qualified independent and external service providers using drug and breath testing devices compliant to Australian and New Zealand Standards.

Integrity Sampling has been engaged to conduct oral drug and alcohol testing at our Australian and New Zealand sites, however this is subject to change at Kmart's discretion.

Team members, labour hire employees, visitors and contractors who are selected for testing are required to undertake the oral drug and alcohol testing, as advised by Kmart management. Selected individuals must be advised of their pending screening, however no set notice period is applicable. The individuals line manager is also advised (this does not apply for labour hire employees, contractors or visitors).

Individuals undergoing testing are required to provide proof of identity. Additional personal information will be required to be included on the test record such as full name, position, employer, employment status (full time, part time, casual or contractor) and date of birth. It is a requirement that team members, labour hire employees, visitors and contractors follow all reasonable directives given by Kmart Management or the testing provider.

If an individual has been selected for random testing on more than 2 consecutive occasions, they can, by mutual agreement (with Kmart Management), be excused from the random testing on that occasion and be replaced with another person randomly selected.

All screenings are conducted in a neutral location within the workplace, away from the mainstream workplace, such as an office / meeting room. Screenings will be conducted in private, individually and without the presence of management. However, an individual may select a witness / support person if they desire and may select to have management present.

For drug testing, the actual screening mouth swab used on the team member is called a primary screening sample.

Each individual undergoing drug and alcohol testing is asked a series of six questions prior to their individual screening, that they are required to answer:

1. Have you had anything to eat or drink in the last 10 minutes?
2. Have you consumed any alcohol in the last 8 hours?
3. Have you taken any illegal drugs in the last 24 hours?
4. Are you currently under the effect of any illegal drugs?
5. Are you taking any medication prescribed by a doctor?
6. Are you taking any over the counter/non prescribed medication?

Where an individual answers "yes" to any of these questions, then the testing staff may seek further clarification and information via additional questions / lines of inquiry. All information supplied is treated confidentially by the testing staff. For example, the testing staff may need to understand what medication you are taking, as this would be a mitigating factor if a positive test is returned for the substance.

The individual is invited to sign a consent to the collection and analysis of their specimen both onsite and if required at an accredited Laboratory for the drugs detailed in the policy and the release of the test results to Kmart or an authorized representative.

## Page 5

If a Kmart employed team member refuses to take or consent to either the drug or alcohol test, Kmart will consider this to be a serious breach of this policy, take steps to remove the individual from site immediately and will take disciplinary action that may include termination of employment. For labour hire employees, visitors or contractors who refuse to take either the drug or alcohol test, they will be asked to leave the site and their services will no longer be required.

Process for Alcohol testing (self-testing)

In some sites, a calibrated breathalyser is located in the bathrooms / locker rooms, for team members to voluntarily use prior to entering the Warehouse and prior to commencing work. If a team member or labour hire employee arrives to work and believes they may have any alcohol in their system, they are encouraged to voluntarily use the on-site breathalyser to test their breath alcohol content (BAC). The self-testing option will not be available where an employee is required to undergo a test for alcohol or drugs in any of the circumstances identified under the heading "Testing Requirements".

Prior to commencing their shift, if the team member or labor hire employee obtains a BAC reading >0.00% they are considered not fit for work and must notify their Kmart Line Manager immediately. The Line Manager will then discuss the following options with them:

• If the BAC reading is >0.00 and <0.04%**, the individual is directed to go to the canteen/lunchroom or first aid room and must retest themselves at regular intervals until they record a BAC of 0.00%. While waiting for their BAC reading to read 0.00% they are not permitted to work. Alternatively, the individual may choose to return home and not work that day. For time not worked individuals be able to utilise paid entitlements (Kmart permanent employees) may*.

• If the BAC reading is 0.04%** or greater the individual is directed to go home immediately and may be able to utilise paid entitlements* (Kmart team members only).

• If the BAC reading is >0.00% and the individual is responsible for operating machinery >1.6 tonnes the individual is directed to go to the canteen/lunchroom or first aid room and must retest themselves at regular intervals until they record a BAC of 0.00%. While waiting for their BAC reading to read 0.00% they are not permitted to work. Alternatively, the individual may choose to return home and not work that day. For time not worked individuals be able to utilise paid entitlements (Kmart permanent employees) may*.

**New Zealand measure alcohol is micrograms (mcg) of alcohol per litre of breath not breath alcohol content (BAC) as a percentage. Accordingly, for the purpose of this policy, 0.05% BAC is equivalent to 250mcg of alcohol per litre of breath, 0.02% BAC is equivalent to 100 mcg and 0.04% BAC is equivalent to 200 mcg. Breathalysers used at New Zealand sites may record an mcg amount not a BAC amount.

If an individual chooses or is directed to go home due to being not fit for work (having a BAC reading >0.00%), then they must find appropriate transport home ie. by taxi (at their own expense) or have a relative or a friend pick them up. Kmart Managers will assist the individual in organizing transport home and the individual will be asked not to drive. Individuals must be aware of the legal driving limits for their driving status. Kmart does not condone the behavior of any individual who chooses to break the law ie. driving with BAC that is greater than the legal limit for their driving class.

* If applicable, employees may apply for sick / personal leave entitlements and therefore receive payment for the shift.

A Kmart team member that in a 12-month period records more than two positive tests (BAC >0.00%) on separate days using the self-testing procedure, will be subject to disciplinary action due to repeated instances of not arriving fit for work.

Self-testing is to be used prior to shift commencement. If an individual commences their shift (commences working) and then self-tests, recording a positive result >0.00% BAC they are required to inform their Line Manager, cease work immediately and wait in the lunchroom / meeting room / first-aid room (as directed by management) to await third party drug and alcohol testing. If found to be positive for alcohol, the outcomes will as per "Outcomes – Confirmed Positive Result to Drug or Alcohol Testing".

Labour hire employees / contractors who use the self-testing breathalyser and record a positive result will have their employer (labor hire agency) contacted and at Kmart's discretion may be informed that they are no longer required at Kmart.

Post Screening Process – Negative Drug Test Result

In the event of a negative reading (no drugs detected), the individual and Kmart will be immediately advised of the result. The individual then returns to work. No opinions of Kmart or other individuals are considered by testing staff.

## Page 6

The testing staff documents each result and a copy can be made available to the individual undergoing testing upon request.

In the case of a drug screening, the sample is immediately destroyed by the tester in the presence of the individual or disposed of appropriately by testing staff.

Post Screening Process – Non-negative Drug Test Result

A non-negative drug test result is when a drug is detected in an initial test. This does not confirm that drugs are definitely present or the amount / concentration present and requires additional sample(s) to be taken and tested in a laboratory.

A positive drug test is where drugs have been detected by a laboratory from a secondary sample.

In the event of a non-negative reading, the individual, their Kmart line manager and the site manager (DC Manager / Operations Manager) are immediately advised of the result. No opinions or comments are offered or considered by the testing staff.

The result is recorded on the Test Record and an edited copy supplied to Kmart preserving confidentiality. This documentation is to include the time and date of the screening, the individuals' details, the screening test record number and the result.

The individual is able to offer any comment on the non-negative screening result, should they choose. Any discussion on the non-negative result is strictly between the individual and the testing staff.

In the event of a non-negative result following drug screening, the following chain of custody process must be immediately implemented:

• a further saliva sample will be taken, divided into A and B samples and each sample sealed with a security seal bearing the date and initials of the individual being tested and chain of custody number. These samples are prepared in the presence of the individual being tested and are for analysis by an accredited analytical Laboratory.
• the samples are sealed into a Chain of Custody bag and initialed by the individual and testing staff.
• The individual is invited to sign a consent to certify that:
    - the specimen identified on the Chain of Custody form was provided by them and given to the collector.
    - the specimen containers were sealed in their presence and placed in a tamper evident Chain of Custody bag.
    - the information provided on the form and the label, are correct.
    - they understand the instructions provided to them by the collector and are aware that the collection and storage of their specimen is in accordance with the privacy act.
    - they consent to the analysis of the specimens for drugs & alcohol solely for the purposes of which they were obtained and the reporting of the results to Kmart and their employer (if not employed by Kmart) or an authorized representative.
    - acknowledge that the specimen will be retained by the accredited Laboratory for a minimum period of 3 months, for independent testing if required.
• The samples are delivered to the analytical Laboratory for screening and confirmation of the initial reading.
• The analytical Laboratory is to supply a certificate of their independent screening result. Two copies of the certificate are served, one to Kmart and one to the individual, usually within 48 hours.
• Testing staff will not participate in any negotiations or discussions related to employment or workplace disciplinary procedures with the individual or Kmart.
• The individual will not be able to work during this process and will be stood down with pay (permanent Kmart employees) until a member of the site management team informs the individual of the results from the pathology lab.
• Kmart will provide the individual with details for drug counselling (usually the Employee Assistance Program) which is a confidential and free service.
• Should the analytical Laboratory confirm that the reading was positive, the individual would be considered to have breached the Code of Conduct and will be subject to formal disciplinary action which may include termination of employment.

All oral drug testing will be conducted using AS/NZS 4760:2019 Procedure for specimen collection and the detection and quantification of drugs in oral fluid (Table 3 - Confirmatory Test Cut-Off Concentrations)

## Page 7

Outcomes - Confirmed Positive Result to Drug or Alcohol Testing

For Kmart employees, a positive reading for the presence of drugs or alcohol will be considered a breach (potentially serious breach) of the Code of Conduct and disciplinary action may be taken by Kmart with the Kmart Team Member concerned. This action taken will be based on the following criteria:

• Alcohol reading >0.00 and <0.02% BAC**
Kmart team member will be withdrawn from the roster / suspended for the shift that day and may be able to access paid entitlements*. They will be permitted to attend their shift the following day after they have self-tested for alcohol via the breathalyzer prior to shift commencement and in the presence of a Kmart manager. The Kmart team member will be coached on their 'fit for work' status. Labour hire employees and others (non-Kmart employees) will be asked to leave the site and will not be permitted to return and will only be paid for hours worked that shift (not the entire shift).

• Alcohol reading between 0.02% and 0.05% BAC**
Kmart team member will be immediately withdrawn from the roster / suspended, without pay and the team member will undergo formal disciplinary action. Labour hire employees and others undertaking testing would be asked to leave the site and would not be permitted to return and will only be paid for hours worked that shift (not the entire shift).

• Alcohol reading >0.05% BAC**
Kmart team member will be immediately withdrawn from the roster / suspended, without pay and the team member will undergo formal disciplinary action which will likely result in termination of their employment. Labour hire employees and others undertaking testing would be asked to leave the site and would not be permitted to return;

• Alcohol reading greater than 0.00% BAC – Plant equipment >16 tonne
Kmart team member will be immediately withdrawn from the roster / suspended, without pay and the Team Member will undergo formal disciplinary action which will likely result in termination of their employment. Labour hire employees and others undertaking testing would be asked to leave the site and would not be permitted to return;

• Confirmed Positive for Illicit Drugs
A Kmart Team Member would have been withdrawn from the roster / suspended with pay (Kmart permanent employees) while they awaited the results of a laboratory test. If the results from the Laboratory are positive, payment of wages will cease and the Team Member will undergo formal disciplinary action which will likely result in termination of their employment. Labour hire employees and others undertaking testing would be asked to leave the site and would not be permitted to return.

**New Zealand measure alcohol is micrograms (mcg) of alcohol per litre of breath not breath alcohol content (BAC) as a percentage. Accordingly, for the purpose of this policy, 0.05% BAC is equivalent to 250mcg of alcohol per litre of breath, 0.02% BAC is equivalent to 100 mcg and 0.04% BAC is equivalent to 200 mcg. Breathalysers used at New Zealand sites may record an mcg amount not a BAC amount.

* If applicable, employees may apply for sick / personal leave entitlements and therefore receive payment for the shift.

For Labour hire team members, the relevant 3PL provider will be contacted and further action in accordance with their employers' policies may ensue.

If an individual is directed to leave site due to being not fit for work (having a BAC reading >0.00%), then they must find appropriate transport home i.e. by taxi (at their own expense) or have a relative or a friend pick them up. Kmart Managers will assist the individual in organizing transport home. Individuals must be aware of the legal driving limits for their driving status i.e. P plater. Kmart does not condone the behavior of any individual who chooses to break the law i.e. driving with BAC that is greater than the legal limit for their driving class.

If an individual does not hold a full licence (Australia) or is under the age of 20 (New Zealand) and records more than 0.00% BAC they will not be permitted to drive themselves home and they will be required to organize alternative transport home. Kmart management will assist the individual to find suitable alternate transport home.

Drug paraphernalia and drugs onsite

In the event that illicit drugs or what is believed to be illicit drugs or drug paraphernalia is located on site i.e. via bag or locker checking, Kmart will involve the appropriate authorities i.e. police. Drug paraphernalia refers to equipment utilised to produce, consume or conceal illicit drugs such as but not limited to bongs and pipes. Individuals in possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia will be required to undergo a drug test and are subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment or removal from site for Labour Hire employees and Contractors.

## Page 8

Team members/labour hire employee or contractors taking pharmaceutical medicines or prescription drugs

A Kmart team member, labour hire employee or contractor who is required to perform work duties, make decisions, operate machinery or a vehicle during their shift and who is taking a prescribed pharmaceutical medicine, prescribed drug or over the counter medication that may impact their performance, must consider their own circumstances and whether they are potentially affected by medication they are taking. It is a requirement that individuals attend fit for work and not adversely affected (affected in a way that impacts their performance and safety) by medications that are taking. Individuals taking medications (prescribed or over the counter) have a responsibility to understand potential side-effects and whether what they are taking will show up on a drug test. Individuals should follow these steps:

1) Review the potential for the medication to have an impact on their ability to perform their job safely and unimpaired. If unsure, the individual should immediately consult with their personal doctor.

2) If a team member or labour hire employee believes the medicine may impact their own and others safety at work, they should seek an alternate medicine from their doctor. If no alternative medicine is available, they should request a doctor's certificate which clearly outlines side-effects and risks relating to their work.

3) Kmart team members and labour hire employees must:
• inform Kmart when first prescribed medication that may affect their performance or behavior at work (based on the advice about the product or advice provided by the prescribing medical professional)
• inform Kmart when first taking "over the counter" medication that may affect their performance or behavior at work (based on the advice about the product or advice provided by the pharmacist)

Notification is a mitigating factor if a non-negative or positive result is returned during the testing process.

Where a team member or labour hire employee is taking prescribed medication, they do not need to disclose to Kmart the nature of the medication they have been prescribed or the condition it is treating where they provide a doctor's certificate that clearly states that they can perform their normal duties safely and are fit for work. The individual must disclose to their doctor, the position which they occupy and the specific tasks they are required to perform. In all cases the Team Member or labour hire employee must provide a copy of the medical certificate to their Line Manager before commencing/returning to his/her duties.

Where Kmart has reasonable concerns whether a Kmart team member or labour hire employee can perform their duties safely while taking medications, the line manager, with support from Safety and or People & Capability specialist, will make a preliminary assessment of the impact on the team member's ability to work (fit for work status), based on available information ie: information for their doctor. Kmart may request further information from the individual's doctor to understand potential side-effects of the medication and the impact this may have on their ability to perform their role and specific tasks in a safe manner and to the expected standard. Based on the circumstances, discussions with the team member and potential information from their doctor, a decision will be made by the Kmart manager and People & Capability and or Safety on whether the team member or labour hire employee can perform usual work duties.

Two options will be explored in the event that that the team member or labour hire employee cannot perform their usual duties to the expected standard or safely, as a result of medication being taken:
• alternate duties to reduce the safety risk
• suspending / withdrawing the Kmart team member from the roster or standing down the labour hire employee

Where this applies to labour hire employees, their employer would be engaged. A Kmart team member stood down as a result of the application of this section, will be able to take annual leave, sick leave or other paid leave until they are able to work safely.

Where Kmart has reasonable concerns as to whether a Contractor can perform their role safely, their employer would be contacted immediately and at Kmart's discretion, a Kmart manager may ask the individual to cease work. Further action may be taken by their employer.

If a team member, labour hire employee or contractor believe the result of their drug test were affected by the use of prescribed pharmaceutical medicine, prescribed drugs or over the counter medication, they should notify the testing staff. After additional laboratory samples are taken, they will be offered the opportunity to leave the workplace to see their doctor for supporting information. Refer to 2 for future steps following this process.

## Page 9

Disciplinary action will not be taken where the team member brings their use of pharmaceutical medicine or a prescribed drug to notice prior to testing and where it is confirmed that the drugs in their system correspond to the medication they are taking and not another illicit substance.

Consumption of Alcohol at Authorised Functions

The Company recognises there will be occasions, where team members may consume alcohol at an authorised function. A work function that includes the provision of alcohol, must have approval from the Head of Supply Chain or General Manager Supply Chain for it to be categorised as an authorised work function. On such occasions, alcohol may be served responsibility and if consumed, must be consumed in a responsible manner by the individual.

Team members may not return to or commence work, until they are able to comply with the Supply Chain Drug and Alcohol Testing Policy and the Code of Conduct.

At an authorised function, alcohol must not be displayed, made available or offered in a manner which encourages excessive consumption ie. unsupervised self-service. In addition to alcohol, soft drinks and low alcohol beverages and food must be provided. The function must be supervised by a member of the management team or outsourced to an authorised caterer to ensure control of alcohol distribution, cessation of alcohol service at the designated time, consideration of participant's ability to return home safely, to ensure that any person under the age of 18 years will not be served alcohol and that alcohol is not consumed in any area where machinery or vehicles are operating.

Education and Support

Kmart will provide ongoing education and support through:
• Inductions
• Policy roll and information sessions / team talks
• Provision of related documents

If any individual does not understand or requires clarification on the drug and alcohol process or associated responsibilities, they are required to seek this clarification and ask questions of their manager. Policies and documents are located on KIT (intranet) and hard copies can be requested from site administration.

Team Member Assistance

It is an obligation of the individual to attend fit for duty and able to perform all work tasks safely and to an acceptable standard.

Assistance will be provided to Kmart Team Members suffering from problems related to the misuse of drugs and alcohol via Kmart's Employee Assistance Program (EAP).

Team Members who are experiencing problems related to the misuse of drugs or alcohol should seek assistance from:
• Their doctor
• Drug and alcohol counselling services
• EAP
• Their manager, who may seek support / guidance from specialist functions within Kmart

Team Members will normally need to undertake any counselling sessions in their own time. It is ultimately the person affected by the alcohol or drugs who must be prepared to take steps to rectify their situation.

A team members employment will not be jeopardised provided that:
• an incident has not yet occurred as a result of his or her behaviour which could otherwise result in disciplinary action being taken by Kmart and;
• the team member agrees to participate in an approved rehabilitation program;
• the Team Member progresses satisfactorily in an approved rehabilitation program and achieves a satisfactory level of job performance in a reasonable period of time;
• a satisfactory level of job performance is maintained following completion of the rehabilitation program.

## Page 10

A Team Member has access to all existing entitlements relating to illness whilst satisfactorily participating in an approved rehabilitation program.

Following consultation, a Team Member may be transferred from his or her normal position, where continuation in that position is believed by Kmart to compromise the health and safety of themselves, others on site, or adversely impact Kmart's operations.

Confidentiality

Information obtained in the process of conducting tests will be treated in the strictest confidence.

Individual test results may not be disclosed to anyone who is not directly involved in the testing process, without a specific written authorisation by the individual except under the following circumstances:
• when the results of the test become subject to a dispute the information will only be released to the involved stakeholders (ie. Employee representatives, Manager and Kmart People & Capability / Safety);
• when complying with a legal requirement;
• in the event of legal proceedings.

Records, testing processes and outcomes must remain confidential. Only the involved stakeholders to the process will be exposed to personal information.

Record Keeping

Copies of all results will be retained for seven (7) years from the date of creation.

Laboratory results will be retained by the laboratory for 3 months.

Access to copies of results of all alcohol or drug tests will be made available to the team member upon request to the testing provider.

Disputes and grievances

Where a dispute or grievance was to occur, refer to the relevant EA or Kmart policy, which is available on KIT (Kmart intranet) or via Kmart management / People & Capability.
