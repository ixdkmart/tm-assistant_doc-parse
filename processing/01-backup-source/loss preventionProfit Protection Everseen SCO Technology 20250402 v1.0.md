Overview of Everseen

What is it?

Everseen is a technology used within the SCO's that detects instances where customers have not scanned products correctly:

• No Scan = Item is not scanned and place into bagging area.
• Basket Base Loss = Items scanned, and items left in basket not paid for at end of transactions.
• Product Switch = A different barcode is used to scan a product.

What are the Benefits?

• Reduction of shrinkage created through SCOs.
• Inventory accuracy (items scanned correctly & paid for).
• Added sales (Items incorrectly/not scanned are scanned adding to sales).
• Assists with operational efficiencies e.g. SCO service, product barcode issues etc.

How it Works in Store

No Scan/Basket Base Loss

Step 1
Customer doesn't scan an item which triggers an intervention and displays video footage of the event.

Step 2
SCO Team Member scans with operator ID, Checks the type of intervention displayed at the top of the screen.

Step 3
Team Member reviews the video and checks products on screen match what has been scanned. Any items not scanned correctly are rescanned.

The transaction can now be completed as normal.

How it Works in Store

Product Switch

Step 1
Customer places the barcode for Colgate toothpaste over the barcode of night wash and places the item into the bagging area. This triggers a product switch alert.

Step 2
SCO Team Member scans with operator ID. Checks the type of intervention displayed at the top of the screen.

Step 3
Team Member reviews the video and checks products on screen match what has been scanned. Any items not scanned correctly are rescanned. Unwanted items are removed.

The transaction can now be completed as normal.

[Note: The image shows three POS screen interfaces displaying the progression of the product switch intervention process, with amounts shown as $2.00, $6.20, and $41.20 respectively]

Which Button Do I Select?

When to select 'Rescan Item':
- When a Kmart product has not been scanned and creates an alert
- (no scan/BBL/Product switch)
Select: Rescan Item

When to select 'Rescan Not Required':
- When a Kmart product triggers an alert but has been scanned and displays on the SCO screen
Select: Rescan Not Required

When to select 'Rescan Not Required':
- When a non-Kmart item triggers an alert (hangers, phones, coffee cups, products from other retailers)
Select: Rescan Not Required

When to select 'Rescan Not Required':
- When a Kmart product triggers an alert because the system identifies a product that has multiple parts e.g. container with a lid
Select: Rescan Not Required

[Note: The image shows a Product Barcode Switch screen with shopping cart items totaling $6.20 and includes a blue starburst saying "This will improve your rescan rates"]

Thorough investigations of each alert is key:

It's important that each alert created by Everseen is investigated:

• Refer to the top of the screen to see what alert type has been triggered e.g. Mis-scanned item.

• Review the video to identify the cause.

• Check the list of items scanned on the POS screen to what is in the bagging area.

• Ensure the SCO areas are clean so rubbish etc. don't trigger interventions.

• Multiple interventions can be a sign of theft.

• Know your top 10 product switch products (refer to the Shrink VMB)

• Blame the machine not the person e.g. for some reason the scanner didn't scan the item, let me rescan it for you.

Alert Type: Product Switch

Scenario: Customer uses sticker barcode for $1 candle on another product. When the alert trigger's they take the barcode off, and place it back on after the alert is cleared.

What went wrong here?
- Screen not reviewed to identify type of intervention
- Video not viewed to see what has triggered the alert
- Items not checked against screen to ensure items scanned correctly
- 'Rescan not required' selected when they should have selected 'Rescan Required'
- SCO area messy with hanger left in picking area
- 2 team members responded to separate alerts for the same transaction, & neither followed the correct process.

## Page 8

Alert Type: No Scan

Scenario: Customer places 1st item in picking area instead of bagging area. They then attempt to place unscanned items into bagging area.

What went right here?
✓ Team member sees the intervention and can see items are placed into pick area.
✓ Video is reviewed.
✓ 'Rescan required' is selected to clear the alert.
✓ Team member checks what is on the screen compared to bag area.
✓ Team member identifies non scanned items & scans them for the customer.

[Note: There appears to be a video player in the image but I cannot extract its contents]

## Page 9

Alert Type: Product Switch

Scenario:
• Customer Scans 1st item, tries to scan 2nd item and alert triggers.
• Additional items are not scanned and placed into bagging area.
• A green mug then triggers a product switch alert as it has a $1 candle barcode on it.
• Another intervention occurs when the helmets are scanned and again have a $1 candle barcode on them.
• Team member then assists with scanning the other items and identifies a $1.50 mug barcode sticker on a frypan.
• Team member then assists with scanning a pillow and identifies a $1.50 mug barcode sticker on it.
• These customers realise they will not get away with the product switch and leave the store empty handed.

What went right here?
✓ Team member responds to each intervention by checking the type of intervention at the top of the screen
✓ Each intervention video is carefully checked.
✓ The items displayed on the screen are matched to what is scanned, identifying they don't match
✓ The products are reviewed, and barcode stickers are removed from each product
✓ Team member stays to assist with scanning products after 2 suspicious alerts have already been triggered.

Getting the Best Results From Everseen

Right People in the Right Place
- Ensure you have the right team members who are trained on SCOs & Everseen, can effectively manage queues and know how to investigate every alert.

Check every intervention carefully
- SCO team members must check every intervention to ensure the correct products are scanned. This will reduce your shrink.

Maintain the SCO area
- To keep false alerts to a minimum, ensure the SCO area is clean (receipts, rubbish, products left behind, hangers etc.)

Customer Service
- Assist customers to use the SCO's correctly, help customers who have large quantities of an item to prevent no scans. Blame the system not the person.

System Observations
- If you are not getting alerts on the SCO, if no video is showing, if there is no alerts in the dashboard, raise an INC with the IT service desk immediately.

Check the eDashboard
- Review video transactions in the dashboard weekly to identify opportunities for team member training and check system efficiency.

Product Switch System Process

Prerequisites
List of product keycodes sent by Kmart to Everseen (Product most likely used in product switch e.g., confectionary, products under $5)

Data Collection
List is reviewed to identify volume of scans per product & select products with 80 to 300 scans per week. These are then sent to the next stage 'Process Data'.

Process Data
Process the list of products into the system to commence product learning (this is completed by the Everseen team). Select products then go into the next stage 'Evaluate product Performance'.

Evaluate Product Performance
Select products then are uploaded into the stores Everseen servers and operate in silent mode to ensure they are responding. If successful products are then placed into the next stage 'Go Live'.

Go Live
Products added to go live and will trigger an alert if used as a product switch.

This process is continuous, and products will be removed when product switch scans are minimal, and others added as our range changes. A list of live products is on Kit.

Everseen Dashboard

The dashboard is available for store leadership teams to view transactions for interventions and ensure team members are following processes correctly checking all interventions and responding correctly.

• It is accessed via the Administration menu on the back office workstation.
• Use the 'Checkout' tab to view transactions.

[The image shows two screenshots:
1. An Everseen login screen with username/password fields and sign in button
2. The Everseen dashboard interface showing transaction monitoring with various charts, alerts, and data tables]

Self-service check-out camera

We have cameras on our self-service registers for the purpose of improving the accuracy of your check-out process along with managing loss prevention.

Helping you self-correct
This technology detects missed scans and products incorrectly scanned. The recording is shown to you can self-correct or receive assistance from our team members.

Protecting your privacy
The recording is from top-down focused on the scanning area. It may capture you from overhead and obscuring controls limit what's visible in the recorded footage. No biometrics are used.

Access to this footage is tightly controlled. It may be shared with police for lawful investigations or the service provider for limited operations to manage functionality; otherwise, it's automatically deleted.

If you do not wish to use self-service, our team members will be able to assist.

Everseen Reporting

Each week you'll receive an email with Everseen reporting. We are working on a power BI version to release in the coming months with even more insights to help support this technology and reduce shrink. We have updated the report to include even more useful information. Here is a list of each tab in the report:

Tab | Description
---|---
NO SCAN (Volume)* | The number of no scan interventions.
NO SCAN ($)* | The number of no scan interventions by value ($5.00 sell price each).
Alert Feedback | NEW: This shows how each intervention was responded to.
Basket Base Loss | The number of Basket Base Loss interventions.
PS (Volume) | The number of product switch interventions.
PS ($) | The number of product switch interventions by value ($8.63 average sell price each).
Outages | Outages reported.

*Only 60% of the no scans are reported to allow for false alerts triggered by items such as mobile phones, hangers etc.

Alert Feedback

• This tracks how team members respond to each intervention, and we want to aim for a 30% will rescan per store.

• There will always be not required for instance where the system detects no Kmart products such as products from other retailers and phones, but we want to reduce this as much as we can, which can be achieve in investigating accurately.

• Unclassified is where the system couldn't identify the alert properly and if the numbers are high could indicate a system issue and should be reported to IT.
