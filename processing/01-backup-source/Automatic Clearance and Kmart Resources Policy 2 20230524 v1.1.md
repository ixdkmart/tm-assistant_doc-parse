Automated Clearance & Kmart Resources

Automated clearance is merchandise that has gone through the 8-week clearance cycle, is at oddment stage, has been discontinued and is being managed by Kmart's automated clearance process.

This policy details that:
• This type of merchandise is not to be intentionally held aside for later purchase or until the lowest price point has been reached
• Team members are not to make selections directly from the stockroom
• Purchases are not to be made during rostered shifts.

This policy also covers the need to advise the manager when merchandise has missed markdowns or not been placed on show, ensures that the merchandise is marked at realistic prices and that line manager approval is required prior to purchase.

Purchasing of automated clearance merchandise
Team members may purchase these items only under the following circumstances:
• The store manager or duty/shift manager has reviewed the price.
• The item is obtained from the selling area.
• The team member is not on duty.
• Purchases are made during trading hours.

Any merchandise that has missed previous markdowns is to be highlighted to the store manager to ensure appropriate action is taken, as required.
Team members found intentionally holding stock aside for later purchase or until a lower price is achieved will be breaching policy guidelines.
Team members found to be breaching the guidelines will face disciplinary action and possible termination of employment.

Automated clearance policy merchandise pricing policy guidelines
Where stock has missed the automated clearance mark down, that is, the merchandise has not been "on show" or "ticketed correctly", the store manager is to be advised.

The store manager or duty/shift manager is to review the item and if appropriate, have the item marked up to a realistic selling price, taking into account the current stock on hand and the saleability of the item.

For Example:
It may be inappropriate to increase the price on a single garment of apparel clothing that has been returned via the service desk or layby. However, if a large number of items, or a full carton was found either on the selling floor or in the stockroom it may be appropriate to "mark up" the merchandise. The price should be set to clear the item within a 14 day period.

The price is to be manually marked on the item and the flag setting changed in IPM to 'price required'. This will prompt the register operator to enter the price set by the store manager when the sale takes place. Store initiated price changes are not to be used to manage this merchandise.
