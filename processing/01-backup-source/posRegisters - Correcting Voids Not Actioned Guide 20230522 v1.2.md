CORRECTING VOIDS NOT ACTIONED

What is this for?
Register errors can be created when a transaction has not been voided correctly utilising the 'Total 10 Non Sale' function. Void slips must state 'Operation Complete' to have been successfully voided.

If you have identified a register error caused by a void not actioned it will need to be corrected. This applies to both sales and refunds that have not been successfully voided when required.

NB: EFT transactions and lay-by payments cannot be corrected in this manner.

Correcting refunds that have not been voided
• Create a sale for the same items, with the same price and cash, as shown on the register receipt / escape print out on the same register where the original error occurred.
This will correct the MR stock on hand for the items and create a compensating shortage for the error reported due to the void not being actioned.

Correcting sales that have not been voided
• Create a refund for the same items, with the same price and cash, as shown on the register receipt / escape print out.
This will correct the MR stock on hand for the items and create a compensating overage for the error reported due to the void not being actioned.
NB: Do not process the refund at the Service Desk registers, the refund should be completed on the register where the original error occurred.

All refund documentation (including any voided e Vouchers) is to be attached to the K162 slip with details entered to the applicable section (for refunds on non-refund registers) and the transactions will require an authorising signature. Register Readings Book / Reconciliation tab in the cash machine spread sheet investigation details should make reference to the W/E that the original error occurred.

EFTPOS Transactions
• If you have identified that a customer was charged twice on their EFTPOS account there is little that can be done. Record the information in to the Register Readings Book / Reconciliation tab in the cash machine spread sheet and the customer will more than likely return to the store for a credit / refund on one of the transactions.
• If you have identified that a customer was given a refund twice on their EFTPOS account there is also little that can be done. Record the investigation information in to the Register Readings Book / Reconciliation tab in the cash machine spread sheet.

Lay-by Transactions
• Refer to the Lay-by Department section of the Register Operations Manual for details on voiding lay-by payments.
