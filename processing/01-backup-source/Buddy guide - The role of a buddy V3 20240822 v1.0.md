Introduction

Welcome to the Buddy program, thank you for helping make a new starter's induction experience a great one.

The buddy program connects new team members with existing team members. This ensures that newly hired team members are quickly and effectively integrated into their new team.

Buddies complement the induction process by working alongside new team members to ensure they feel welcome and included in the new team.

As a buddy, you will act as an ambassador for a new team member, communicates the organisation's culture, and relates job and non-job specific information. A buddy should be accessible to the new starter, have the time to perform this role and should not be on leave during the first critical weeks. Doing so may leave the new hire feeling stranded.

A buddy provides moral support during the first few weeks by introducing the new starter to team members and showing them around their new workplace.

The buddy relationship is not the same as that of a manager. Your role is to be a supportive colleague and friendly face.

Your responsibilities

Your role as a buddy is to support through:

• Helping the new starter to navigate their way around the store/office- this could be showing them how to do aspects of their role or checking in to see they have met a deadline.

• Answering questions – often more than once. Buddies need to be patient, as new starters take in a lot of information, often in a short time, and may need to re-ask questions in the future as events occur.

• Providing information, navigating where to find resources and providing informal support.

• Introducing them to other team members who are important to their role.

• Helping them to understand the formal and informal culture and structures at Kmart Target.

• Encouraging them to ask questions if unsure about any aspects of their role.

• Arranging with their manager a way to celebrate the new starter after a set period of time so they can be recognised and feel part of the team.

The buddy is not:
• A line manager
• A direct report
• A professional counsellor
• A career mentor

3 Phase relationship

Your buddy relationship will go through 3 phases: the welcome, the check-ins and finally an ongoing connection.

To help a you and the new starter develop a relationship, we have a 3-step process. Remember, every relationship is different so let it happen organically rather than forcing it.

Make this buddy program your own - have fun and find the benefit of being part of a new professional connection.

1. Welcome
- Make the effort to welcome the new starter to the team! This can be through a text, phone call or even in person.
- Make the time to have this welcome conversation ideally before day 1 or within their first week.
- Make contact & welcome the new starter to the team
- 10 mins each day
- Phone, text or in person
- Refer them to Our Learning Hub (LMS)
- Get to know them, their background and why they are excited to work with us

2. Check-in
- In the first few weeks they will be trying to orient themselves to how we do things here, so take the time to check-in.
- As a buddy it is most helpful if you check in regularly, explain the company language and answer their questions.
- Regular check-ins
- 10 mins each day
- Phone, text or in person
- Refer them to the company process documents
- Have regular catch-ups to build the relationship. They may not need you but they will appreciate knowing you are there

3. Connect
- Finally stay connected and advise.
- As the new starter gets more confidence they won't need as much guidance. However stay connected with them to advise and support where required.
- Available for advice & support
- Ad-hock
- Phone, text or regular catch-ups
- Refer them to the relevant programs and additional learning resources

Every buddy relationship will look different.

At times, you may see an opportunity to have a check-in conversation. Here are some check-in conversation questions to get you started.

Remember your role as a buddy is to support the new starter - so make sure not to record your conversations.

Check-in conversation starters
□ How are you feeling?
□ What have you noticed about Kmart Target so far?
□ What are you finding you need help with?
□ Is there anything I can clarify for you?
□ Are there any 'dumb' questions that you haven't felt comfortable to ask?
□ What wins have you had so far?
□ How are you finding the team?
□ Is there any Kmart Target lingo that you don't understand?
□ What examples have you seen so far of the Kmart Target values being lived?
□ Is there anything that could help you feel more supported?

Connected conversation
It is important that the buddy relationship happens organically. One check-in conversation may be different from the next one. However as a buddy try having a connected conversation every so often.
