Tips to Reduce eVoucher Washing

eVoucher washing is a method in which an individual will obtain an eVoucher in a transaction.

They later return to the store to get a refund, however, attempt to get the refund back as cash/EFT or back onto their credit card.

How to Avoid eVoucher Washing?
• Check the receipt against the POS screen (POS is the source of truth).
• Only refund back the way the purchase was paid for e.g., if the original purchase was paid for with an eVoucher, then only an eVoucher can be provided.

Here's an example...
• You scan a receipt for a refund request, and the transaction appears on the POS screen.
• Check the receipt matches what is on the POS screen.
• In this example the customer wants a full refund.
• As the original transaction was paid for as $2 EFT & $78 as an eVoucher the customer must be refunded with $2 on the same EFT card used in the purchase, and $78 onto an evoucher.
