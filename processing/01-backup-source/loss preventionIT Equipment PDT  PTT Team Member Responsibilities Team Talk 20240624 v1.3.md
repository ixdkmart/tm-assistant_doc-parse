Messages for Store/Management team to deliver.

Last year Kmart and Khub stores lost $1 million in PDTs. PDTs and other IT equipment are critical to the operation of the store. Without enough of these devices the store cannot complete critical processes like picking and packing online orders, backfill and other inventory tasks, as well helping our customers in store and on the phone.

• Team members should ensure they take care of Kmart IT equipment. This includes keeping devices on their person, using the Kmart PDT belt, and never leaving IT equipment unattended.
• If a team member cannot find a device, they should report this to a manager as soon as possible, and action should be put in place to find the device.
• Each shift the device should be returned to the correct docking station and be logged out, devices should never be left in team members lockers or taken out of the store.
• If you find a device unattended in the store, Take the device to a manager as soon as you can. Devices should always be on a team members person and not left unattended.

When a device is lost, the store needs to report this to National Office and the Zone Manager, and the store will have one less device to complete important tasks. The replacement cost of these lost devices for FY24 will come out of the store's bonus pool.

Let's reset the store standards, check throughout the store, and make sure all PDTs, phones and push to talks are returned to the charging stations.
