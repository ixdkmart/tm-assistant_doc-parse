Voiding e-Vouchers: registers

During the transaction (void total)

During the transaction, (up until transaction has been finalised), you can void the transaction by pressing void and then total. This will also put the value back onto the e-Voucher to be used again.

e-Voucher Multi tender transaction
If the full e-voucher has been redeemed, but there is still an amount owing, the transaction can still be void totaled, the amount taken off the e-Voucher will automatically go back onto the e-Voucher.

After the transaction (void previous)

As e-Vouchers go through the EFT system, you cannot perform a void previous on them (total 10 non sales). You will need to process it as a refund by following the below process. This is only to be processed on a service desk register.

e-Voucher Completed transactions
If you have redeemed an e-Voucher and for whatever the reason may be determine that it is incorrect, follow these steps:

1. Deface the voucher and place in cash drawer to be sent to cash office in next clearance as we still need to account for the voucher.
2. Take the goods to the service desk for an e-Voucher to be issued.
3. Process the sale correctly using the new e-Voucher.
