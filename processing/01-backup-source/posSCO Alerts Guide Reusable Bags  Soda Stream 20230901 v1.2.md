SCO Alerts Guide (Reusable Bags & Soda Stream)

The Self-Service Checkouts (SCOs) have alert functions to assist customers and inform Team members for the following:

• Bag alerts - displays an icon at the bottom of the SCO screen, displaying a number that represents the number of reusable bags scanned within a purchase.
• Soda Stream alerts - display alert for the SCO Team Member to visually verify a Soda Stream purchase for an exchange of a cylinder.

This guide steps through these processes with screenshots of how each alert is displayed on the SCO POS screen.

Step 2
When a bag is scanned, a quantity of 1 will be displayed in the bag icon located at the bottom right side of the screen. This makes it easy for team members to ensure customers have scanned reusable bags for their transaction.

Info
It is important that every customer is provided with great service and is never accused of any wrongdoing. Missed scans of bags can be accidental and each case should be treated the same.

If you notice a customer has a reusable bag, however there is no quantity scanned in the bag icon, start the conversation with: "Hi how are you today. It looks like your reusable bag didn't scan through. Would you like me to help with this?". Point to the bag icon that shows no bags scanned and again once a bag is scanned to keep them informed and will help prevent the customer not scanning a bag again in the future.

If at any stage a customer becomes agitated follow the 5D's and report it to a manager as soon as possible.
