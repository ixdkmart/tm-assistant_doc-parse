Transactions Between $100 and $150

The first model that is within the escape system is 'Transactions between $100 and $150. As this is only a model, you will need to alter certain parameters to allow for a search of dates, register number, or operator ID that you are reviewing. You can also change the dollar values and search for sales of different values.

Example
In this example, we have altered the original model, and put in the search parameters of 5/12/20 to 05/12/2021 for register number 50 for a full search. Therefore, we have searched for all transactions between $100 and $150 on register 50 on 05/12/2021.
The results say that there is 1 hit, and that will be shown in the search results box.

Cash Tender or Change Between $150 and $60

The cash tender or change between $50 or $60, can be used to investigate customer queries or register errors.

Example

In this example, we have altered the original model, and put in the search parameters of 4/12/2021 to 4/12/2021, register 4, and a full search. Therefore, we have searched for all cash transactions on register 1 on 8/02/02 that had change between $50 and $60. The results say that there are 2 hits, that will be shown in the search box.

Incomplete Void of a Previous Transaction

The incomplete void of a previous transaction can be used to investigate register errors and void variances. After you have loaded the model, you will need to alter the pre-set parameters to allow you to search for the applicable dates, register number, or operator ID you are reviewing.

Example

In this example, our search has found 0 instances between 06.09.2021 to 07.12.2021 where previous voids (non-sales) have not been correctly completed. Note: You will need to check the remaining voids to ensure the transaction was not correctly voided in another transaction. Void transactions do not occur frequently within stores.

EFTPOS With Cash Out Transactions

The basic model allows you to search for EFTPOS sales that have a cash out component. You would use this search to assist in EFT and customer queries.

Exchange Vouchers with Change:

By using the model for cash tender or change between $50 and $60, you can alter it to reflect any other combinations. One of these could be exchange vouchers with change. This would be done by altering the cash tender in the range search to vouchers, changing the 'or' to 'and' then altering the dollar values to what you wish to search for.

Items That Have Been Overridden:

By entering in the combination search 'charge' and 'PO'. Please note: Ensure that the PO is entered with double quotes and a space between the first quote and the letter P, otherwise the search will find the word DEPOSIT as well.
