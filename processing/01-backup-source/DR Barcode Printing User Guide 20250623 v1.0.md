Attaching a barcode

H-Cages
• H-Cage will have two barcodes either side of the cage, those barcodes are supplier barcodes.
• If you need to replace both barcodes, you can re print using the barcode printing steps.

Z Rails
• Z-Rails will need two barcodes attached to all rails.
• Barcodes are to be attached vertically as per the picture on both poles of the rail.
• To ensure the stickers remain attached please use clear tape to hold down, best practice is to wrap around the pole and use the clear online tape.
