Kmart No Apprehension Policy

This policy outlines the procedures and standards for dealing with an incident of shop theft in Kmart stores. External theft and shop stealing are a common issue that retailers deal with on a daily basis. The process of identifying, apprehending and arresting shoplifters is time consuming, dangerous, and costly.

No Apprehension Policy Purpose & Application

Policy purpose: To ensure no Team Members or Managers apprehend or accuse a person for wrongdoing regardless of circumstances and reporting all incidents to managers who log it into the Solvsafety Profit Protection Incident form via Kit.

Policy application: This policy applies to all Kmart Team Members

Country application: Australia and New Zealand

No Apprehension Policy
Under no circumstances are any Kmart Team Members authorised to apprehend, arrest, seize, hold, restrain or detain any person where there is an allegation that the person has stolen, regardless of the reason or circumstances. That includes locking of that individual in a room to prevent that person from leaving the store or requesting that person to come back into the store.

Under no circumstances are any Kmart Team Members to accuse a person of any form of wrongdoing regardless of the circumstances. If someone has left the store with goods that are not paid for, record the time, any relevant details and provide this information to your line manager to report the incident into the Solvsafety Profit Protection incident report form via the Quick links section on Kit.

It is very important that no one chases, follows, or tries to stop any shoplifter exiting a store, and that the Don't be a Hero (5D's process is adhered to).
