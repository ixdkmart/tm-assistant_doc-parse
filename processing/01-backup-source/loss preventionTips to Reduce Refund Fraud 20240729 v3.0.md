Tips to Reduce Refund Fraud

With refund fraud on the rise, it's more important than ever to ensure the policy & processes are followed to 100%.

Tip # 1 Communications between Customer Greeter & Service Desk Team:
As Customers enter the store, identify those visiting for a refund, identifying what they are returning & communicate this to the Service desk via 2T. Also advise customer to keep receipts for refunds.

Tip # 2 Refunds must be paid to the same tender as the original purchase:
Scan the receipt at POS, to confirm the original tender payment type. For card payments match the last 4 digits of the card on the receipt to the physical/digital wallet card. If the customer doesn't have the original card, refer to the refund policy or call a manager for assistance.

Tip # 3 eVoucher Washing:
To prevent eVoucher washing, always refund back the same way the transaction was paid. This includes eVouchers. If a payment was made with an eVoucher, then the refund must be provided back as an eVoucher. Always check the POS screen against the receipt to validate.

Tip # 4 Refunds request, but the receipt won't scan:
If the refund is over $100, search in POS for the original receipt, or ask a manager for assistance to identify the transaction in escape.

Tip # 5 Refund Authorisation
Refunds over $250 must be reviewed & authorised by a Manager. The Manager must be present to authorise this and scan their barcode.
