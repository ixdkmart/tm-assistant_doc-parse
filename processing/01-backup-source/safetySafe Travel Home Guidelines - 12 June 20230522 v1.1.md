Safe Travel Home and After Dark Guidelines

Kmart takes seriously its obligations with regard to the employment and the safety of its team members, including the safe travel home from work and leaving their store after dark. Kmart requires all team members and managers to follow the guidelines set out below. Please note additional requirements apply for those team members aged under 15 years.

For team members:
1. Refer to the parking conditions for your store's location and where permitted by centre management, park close to the entrance of the store if there is parking available.
2. Never put yourself in harm's way. For example, if you feel like you are in a vulnerable situation, remain calm, try to remove yourself from danger and contact a manager.
3. Always ensure you arrive and leave via an approved entrance.
4. Where possible, when leaving or arriving at the store during extended hours, ensure you are escorted to and from the building.
5. Leaving after dark:
   • When leaving after dark make sure a manager knows that you are leaving and can access transport safely, including public transport.
   • Where possible, walk in groups or with another team member
   • Make sure you walk on pathways and remain in well-lit areas
   • Speak to your manager about your sites procedure when needing to wait for transport after dark i.e. waiting in the store until the transport arrives or having security escort you.
6. If you are under 15:
   • ensure a parent/ guardian or a person nominated by your parent/guardian drops you off and picks you up from an approved entrance.
   • Check with your manager what these approved entrances are for your store e.g. front of the store during trading hours or the team member entrance outside of hours.
   • Ensure your parent/guardian or person nominated by your parent/guardian remains with you until you enter the approved entrance.
   • If they are delayed picking you up, stay with a manager until they arrive.;
   • If you are asked to stay back or change your working hours during your shift always telephone your parent/guardian to ensure that they are available to pick you up before accepting the change to your hours.

For managers:
1. Ensure all team members are aware of where the approved entrances are and the site procedures for arriving and leaving safely after hours or after dark.
2. Encourage team members to follow the arriving and leaving safely guidelines
3. Ensure you meet the child employment legislation obligations for those under 15-years old:
   • Take all reasonable steps to ensure that team members, have arrangements in place for safe travel home after their shift has finished. For example, asking the team member whether their parent, guardian or a person nominated by the child's parent or guardian is collecting them at the end of their shift.
   • During a team member's shift, if changes to their hours are contemplated, managers must first ensure that the team member has notified their parent/guardian to ensure they are available to pick them up or re-arrange their transport home, prior to making the change.
