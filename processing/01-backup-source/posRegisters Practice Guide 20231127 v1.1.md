Registers Practical Activity Guide

The purpose of this guide is to ensure team member/s know how to safely work on the register to serve our customers. It's an opportunity for them to practise the key steps of operating a register with their line manager using the training environment on the register.

Prior to completing the tasks in this guide, ensure the team member has successfully completed the Registers learning module on Our Learning Hub.

The task activities can be done in groups of team members depending on the number of registers available.

It should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. It is divided into three parts.

Part A | Completion of the reminders checklist by the line manager with team member/s | 3 mins
Part B | A practical demonstration given by the line manager with the team member/s on registers processes | 10 mins
Part C | Confirm with team member/s they can successfully complete registers key processes | 2 mins
