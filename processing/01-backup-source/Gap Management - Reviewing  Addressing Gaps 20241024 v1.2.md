GETTING STARTED
[Visual guide showing gap assessment process]

Whole Gap:
>1: Cover fully
<1: Leave
Shelf: Module
Gap Size (up to)

PROCESS
1. Your manager will tell you which areas to review gaps in.
2. For each gap with an OOS label, determine how big the gap is.
3. Check the OOS label and see what action to take for the size of gap.
   S: Cover
   M: Cover
4. If it says 'Cover', check to see if there is enough stock of an adjacent item to cover the gap fully.
   - First, check to the left
   - If there's not enough stock then check to the right

5. IF THERE'S NO STOCK EITHER SIDE...

...OR IF YOU'D HAVE TO CHANGE THE SHELVES OR PEGS.

COVER THE GAP BY SPREADING THE AVAILABLE STOCK ACROSS THE EMPTY SHELVES.

...OR PEGS.

7. WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED REVIEWING GAPS, LET YOUR MANAGER KNOW.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW

8. THE MANAGER MAY DECIDE TO DRESS THE SIDE WITH OTHER PRODUCT.

USE OVERSTOCK/PRODUCT FROM THE SAME CATEGORY TO DRESS THE SIDE...

KEEPING THE FITTINGS AND OOS LABELS IN PLACE.

9. IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE FITTINGS TO DRESS THE SIDE...

PUT ALL OOS LABELS ON THE BOTTOM SHELF.

10. PLACE SHELF EDGE LABELS FOR THE TEMPORARY PRODUCTS AND HIGHLIGHT THE LABEL.

THIS WILL IDENTIFY THE LABELS THAT CAN BE REMOVED WHEN STOCK ARRIVES FOR THE SIDE.
