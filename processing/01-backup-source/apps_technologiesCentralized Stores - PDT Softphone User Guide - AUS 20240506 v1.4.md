PDT(TC51) - SIP Softphone - User Guide

Within selected PDT's a phone app will appear. Within this app, you will now have the ability to make phone calls just as you would with a Desk Phone or a DECT cordless phone.

When you first open the app, you will be greeted with the following page which should look like a familiar phone app.

There has been one major change to your Desk phones, DECT cordless phone & now your PDT soft phone. Your dialing plan has been changed from 3 digits to 7 digits. This means when making a phone call to an internal EXT, you must now prefix your store number in front of the EXT number you wish to call.

For example, using 1106 Cranbourne.

If you wish to dial the Store managers EXT 651, you would need to prefix it with 1106
Which would make the full EXT number 1106651, which can be seen below.
