Report Suspicious Behaviour

It's everyone's responsibility to be alert and vigilant in identifying suspicious behaviour.

If you see something suspicious or unusual, say something.

SEE Something

• If something looks out of place such as products or parcels being left in unusual locations.
• Empty packets (including back of house areas).
• Witnessing a theft occurring.
• Leaving the store with stock that has not been paid for.
• Leaving a store without bags being checked
