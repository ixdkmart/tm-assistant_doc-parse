Introduction to Decant

Stock is delivered from our Distribution Centres to our stores on pallets or in foldable bins. They are unloaded from the truck, and this is where the decant process begins.

Decant is where all packaging and waste is removed from the cartons and foldable bins. The stock is micro sorted into categories ready to be filled to the shopfloor.

[Image shows a warehouse area with cardboard boxes, blue bins, and metal storage racks/cages arranged in rows]

The Benefits of Decant

• Removes cardboard, rubbish, waste and trip hazards from the shopfloor.

• Improved speed to shelf, with a 24-hour load turnaround.

• Improved productivity.

• Improved visibility of stock on H cages and Z rails.

• Improved H cage and Z rail sortation for load fill.

• Provided role clarity for the team.

5s Principles

5s is a set of 5 principles designed to improve organisation cleanliness and efficiency in the workplace.

The 5S process involves assessing everything in the space, removing what is unnecessary, organizing things logically adding visual cues for the team, keeping the area clean, and ensuring this is always sustained.

By following these 5S principals and embedding them as part of your stores culture you will:
• Improve productivity
• Improve team member morale
• Reduce costs
• Improved safety performance

5S Lean Workplace:
- Sort: Keeping only what is necessary and discard everything else
- Set In Order: Arranging and labelling necessary items for easy use and return
- Shine: Keeping everything swept and clean
- Standardise: The state that exists when the first 3 5s are properly maintained
- Sustain: Making a habit of properly maintaining correct procedures

Waste

Waste refers to any activity or action that does not add value to the customer or the business.

In retail, waste can manifest in several different ways such as long wait times, inefficient or unnecessary processes, or actions that we take that decreases our productivity and makes our roles more complex.

What is Waste?
D - Defects: Damaged stock that can't be sold or fails to meet expectations
O - Over Production: Stock arriving early or making more than required
W - Waiting: Waiting for instructions, information or equipment
N - Non-Utilised Talent: Not utilising a person's skill, experience, knowledge or creativity
T - Transportation: Unnecessary movement of equipment or stock
I - Inventory: Excess stock in the stockroom taking up valuable space
M - Motion: Walking without a H cage, Z rail or product
E - Extra Processing: Individually pricing boxed product instead of changing the label

Safety

All team and managers are to follow the safety principles to protect themselves from injuries and maintain a safe work environment.

All team members to complete the mandatory safety training modules.

Huddles and warm-ups to be completed at the beginning of decant.

Correct PPE to be worn:
•Gloves – to protect from cuts and lacerations and will assist to handle boxes.
•Carton Cutters – approved carton cutters to be used.
•Safety Boots – to be worn to protect feet from injury.

Rotation of tasks or mini rest breaks should to every 30 minutes.

H Cages should not exceed 1.5m high.

Foldable bins to be accessible from both sides to prevent overreaching.

Two team members are required to lift and stack empty pallets.

Four team members are required to lift and stack empty foldable bins.

Team members should never lift, push or drag empty pallets or foldable bins by themselves.

Floors to be swept during decant to prevent slips and trips.

Crates to be stored under the decant tables to prevent trip hazards.

Crates are to be interlocked when stacked and not overfilled.

A facilitator must be in place to ensure all the above requirements are met.

Our Learning Hub

In addition to the mandatory safety training, there are two decant modules to be completed.

These are to ensure the team have the knowledge and skills to perform tasks safely, efficiently and to drive operational excellence.

To be completed by all managers, facilitators and all team members who work in decant.

Preparing Pallets for Decant

Writing the time standards on the pallets supports to understand the workload per pallet and assists with pallet placement when unloading the truck.

Completing this can increase productivity by 15 cartons per hour.

1. Locate the carton count written on the consolidation sticker on the pallet.
2. Using the CPH Calculator (available on KIT) locate the carton count of the pallet to convert it to the time standard.
3. Use a thick marker pen to write the time standard clearly on the shrink wrap.
Ensure the number is
• Large and legible for easy viewing
• Facing the decant team for visibility
4. Repeat this for all pallets.

Note: NZ manifest consolidation information is to be obtained from the decant and sequence planning tool.

Pallet Placement

When unloading the truck, pallets and foldable bins are to be placed in the configuration shown below to maximise productivity during decant.

During the trial it was found that the team were energised at the beginning of decant and completing the highest carton count pallets and foldable bins first resulted in a 20% improvement in productivity and the team achieved a higher CPH for the load.

[Diagram showing three rows of pallet placement with arrows indicating:]
• Low carton count pallets placed at the back.
• High carton count pallets in front of low carton count pallets.
• Foldable bins placed in the front row to be processed first.

Stockroom Zone Signage

Having an organised stockroom with clearly defined areas provides visibility of workload and maintains 5s standards.

The below zones are to be set up in the stockroom with signage displayed.

Zone 1
Pallets and foldable bins unloaded from the truck are placed here and ready for decant.

Zone 2
Micro sorted H cages and Z rails from decant are placed here in department category order ready for sequence.

Zone 3
Overstock H cages and Z rails from load fill are placed here in department category order ready for pack away.

Micro Sortation Signage

Having micro sortation signage in place supports the team to clearly identify which H cage or Z rail stock should be placed on during decant.

• In Zone 1 and 2, all H cages and Z rails are to have micro sortation signage displayed. Each zone requires 1 set of signage.

• The signage is to be displayed in the same order for each decant to keep it consistent for the team to improve productivity.

• Ideally the signage is to be attached permanently to a wall above the H cages/Z rails, alternatively the signage can be hung on the H cages/Z rails.

[The image also shows example signage designs for each zone and photos of H cages/Z rails with signage]

## Page 9

Equipment Cage Signage

Having equipment signage in place supports the team to clearly identify where equipment is to be stored when not in use, this maintains a safe stockroom and 5s standards.

All equipment used for decant is to be stored in a predetermined designated position under the relevant signage.

[Decant Tables sign with downward arrow and instruction to ensure decant tables are folded and stacked safely]

Decant Equipment

Having the correct equipment is required to complete an effective and safe decant.

Decant Table
- All products from pallets and foldable bins are to be decanted over the tables.

Crates
- All small and breakable items are to be placed into crates.

Z Rail
- Used to micro sort clothing into categories.

H Cage
- Used to micro sort products and to transport them to and from the shopfloor.

H Cage Shelf
- Used to add additional shelves to the H cage, to organise stock and ensure a safely stacked H cage.

Safety Step
- Used to reach items above shoulder height to prevent overreaching.

[Images show examples of each piece of equipment mentioned]

## Page 10

Decant Set Up Area

The decant area is to be set up as shown below for each decant.

[Diagram showing layout from top to bottom:]
- Low carton count pallets
- High carton count pallets
- Foldable Bins
- Decanters
- Decant tables, cardboard cages and plastic
- Sorters
- Facilitator
- Empty H cages and Z rails

Decant
• Decant tables are to be assembled in this area. A H cage for cardboard waste, with a plastic waste bag tied to the side or a plastic waste bin is to be placed between each table.

• All cartons from pallets and foldable bins are to be decanted on the tables for safety and productivity.

• Crates are to be placed under the decant tables for micro sortation, excess crates to be stored on a cage.

Sortation
• Empty H cages/Z rails are placed in a line in the designated micro sortation area in front of the decant tables.

• Where possible place an additional equipment cage in the middle of the micro sortation cages to store crates and cages shelves.

• Crates and H cage shelves are easily accessible.

Note: The decant area is to be set up prior to the commencement of the team starting the shift.

## Page 11

Huddle

A huddle is to occur at the beginning of each decant by a manager. Huddles provide the team with important updates, checks the team safety and assigns the roles and workload.

Decant Huddle Agenda (10-minute check in to be completed in the stockroom in the decant area)

Welcome and Warmup
• Warmups to be completed with 6 repetitions of each prescribed exercise.

Safety
• Check all team members have the correct equipment and PPE. (Gloves, safety boots, carton cutters etc.)
• Remind the team of safe moving techniques and two person lifts for heavy items and empty pallets, four person lifts for foldable bins.
• Safety updates.

Operations
• Sales and profit protection updates.
• Load size including carton counts.

Role Assignment
• Assign roles, decanters and sorters and assign table to work from.
• Planning tool forecasted completion time.
• Carton per hour target vs. actual cartons per hour for the store.

Kudos and Feedback
• Feedback from the previous decant or sequence.
• Any focus areas required for the shift.

Note: The team should start and finish at the same time. It is recommended that decant is a 3-hour or 3.5hour shift. This is the optimum shift length for maximised productivity.

5. Clothing/Home/Kids – This highlights the department split in the pallet to support with pallet placement.

6. Full Bulk Pallets – This highlights the bulk pallets in the manifest and the quantity.

Note: The consolidation information will be visible for each manifest you enter.

## Page 21

How to Calculate Cartons Per Hour (CPH)

The CPH calculation is required to understand stores current performance compared to the business standard of 90 cartons per hour.

Calculate: Locate the carton count available for the load in the manifest visualiser.

Start Timer: Using a timer, the decanters are to commence cutting the first carton all at the same from their individual pallets.

End Timer: Stop the timer when the last carton of the load has been cut.

Calculation
Cartons divided by / Total number of hours of decanters = CPH

Example
900 cartons divided by / 10 hours (4 decanters, times for 2.5 hours decanting) = 90 Cartons Per Hour.

Decant Health Checks

Completing regular self-health checks help to maintain process standards and identify opportunities for continuous improvement.

These are available in Safety Culture and support with ensuring the decant principles are consistently followed.

Decant Troubleshooting

The below scenarios will help to support during the times things may not go to plan.

What do I do if the decant team are not cutting at 90 cartons per hour?
• Complete the cartons per hour calculation to understand the actual CPH.
• Make sure the decant principles are set up covered in this manual are in place and complete a decant self health check.
• Ensure all the team, facilitators and managers have completed the decant LMS modules.
• Ensure the facilitator is providing coaching, keeping the pace and providing feedback and kudos.

What can I do if the team didn't complete all the workload, and I have 3 pallets left over?
• Understand the reason behind why the pallets were not completed during decant.
• Discuss with the management team and work to put a plan together for improvement.
• Calculate the carton counts of the pallets left over and add this to the carton counts on the next load. (Remember if you have already rostered for this workload, the remuneration would have already been spent, discuss with the store or zone manager if additional hours are required.)

What can I do if I keep running out of equipment?
• Review the sequence process to make sure the principles are in place and complete a sequence health check.
• Review the decant process to make sure the principles in place.
• Ensure the facilitator is validating the micro sortation standards throughout the crates, H cages and Z rails.

The planning tool is allocating 3 decanters and 2 sorters, how do I manage this with the 2 decanters to 1 sorter ratio requirement?
• Set up the decant area with two tables.
• When assigning the roles to the team members make sure the strongest decanter is working on 1 table with 1 sorter, and the remaining 2 decanters and 1 sorter work on the next table, keeping with the 2:1 ratio.
