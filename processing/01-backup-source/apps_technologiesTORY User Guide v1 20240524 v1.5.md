Moving TORY

You may be required to move TORY at times, either between chargers or when runs are aborted and Tory's breaks are engaged

**PLEASE NOTE: Do not push Tory when breaks are engaged**

Please follow the below steps when moving TORY.

• Press and release the emergency stop button
• TORY should now be easy to push when breaks have been disengaged (please be gentle).
• Carefully push Tory to the second charging station.
    • To dock, line up the metal bars on TORY, with the metal prongs on the charging dock.
    • Repeat step 1 if timeout is reached when moving

Bot Troubleshooting

Issue | Solution
---|---
TORY is turning off and on | Turn TORY off with the key, wait 5 seconds, turn Tory back on.
TORY isn't charging | Turn the bot off and the charger (turn the power off and remove the cable from the power point) leave off for 30 seconds before plugging the power back in and everything back on.
TORY LED screen is blank | Try turning TORY off with the key, wait 5 seconds before turning TORY back on.

Reading a Map

Hit waypoints
Green dots are waypoints that TORY has hit. TORY can spend up to 30 seconds at each point, rotating to read all the tags.

Missed waypoints
The red dots show you the waypoints TORY has not got to. This could be due to a blockage in the path. TORY will attempt multiple times to hit every waypoint.

Alternative waypoints
Yellow dots are a waypoint the bot couldn't get to and the yellow outlined green dot is the alternative waypoint taken, joined by a yellow line.

TORY's run path
The red line is the run path TORY took. Thicker and darker lines tell you that TORY may have mis-localised or has had to find alternative ways to get to a particular waypoint.

Bumper Issue
In the event of a 'bumper' issue: It will appear on the map as yellow X's, assisting you to understand what has happened at that point of the run

Failed Runs -Root cause analysis

Stores will experience failed runs on occasions. It is important for stores to find the root cause of the failed run.

If your store has a failed run, please follow the below steps:

Start investigating root cause:
• Check Bot
• Check run map
• Where did the run go wrong?
• What impacted the run?
• Steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again?

If your store has two consecutive failed runs. (not the stores fault), please see below process:

• PIA (Process Improvement Analyst) will make contact via email.

• If the store has not heard from the PIA on the second failed run, please raise with the IT Help Desk, ensure to keep the INC Number

Note: When entering your reason for your failed runs in iAuditor, please be detailed, there is a section to add an action, to prevent it happen again

## Page 25

Managing Runs
Failed Runs and Robot Status

Most common interrupted/failed run reasons:

| Interrupt Reason | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Timeout | The run timed out for taking too long |
| Too many skeletons skipped | The bot is unable to reach skeleton points after multiple attempts |
| Too many waypoints skipped | The bot is unable to reach waypoints after multiple attempts |
| Timeout with low run quality | The run timed out for taking maximum allocated time and the run quality was poor |
| Aborted | The inventory run was aborted due to Tory being switched off or a software issue during the run |

Robot Status:

| Interrupt Reason | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| OK | The bot is all good, no issues |
| Emergency Stop Pressed | The EM Stop button has been pressed on Tory. No runs will occur until the button has been switched off. Please note there are two EM Stop button on Tory so be sure to check both. |
| Motor Stop | There is an internal error with Tory. Switch Tory off using the key, wait 5 seconds, and turn back on. If error persists, please raise with IT service desk |

If you have an interrupted run that isn't one of the reasons above, please reach out to the PIA who will review and can help troubleshoot.

• All Tory runs are allocated a maximum run time which is set by PIA during bot set-up

• This is to ensure that Tory doesn't run all day if there are any run issues

• These time will vary depending on store size and other factors such as difficulty of stockrooms etc.

Timeouts can be caused by obstructions on Tory's path causing it to take longer to reach the points on its path or even difficult stockroom areas (as seen in above example)

Mislocalised
Tory is unable to determine where it is on the map causing it to be lost and unable to reach the skeleton points. This also gives a very skewed run map.

Closed Doors
The stockroom doors were not left open, Tory tried multiple ways out of the stockroom, as seen by the bold red line, before interrupting the run.

• The skeleton path is the initial path Tory takes around the main aisles of the whole store. This path is key in ensuring Tory knows its location throughout the rest of the run

• Tory will interrupt the run if points on the skeleton path can't be reached after multiple attempts

• The waypoint path is a more detailed path that Tory will take up and down the aisles on both the shop floor and in the stockroom

• Tory will interrupt the run if points on the skeleton path can't be reached after multiple attempts

This is usually caused by congestion or obstacles/equipment in the aisles, but can also be caused by Tory getting mislocalised and believe it's unable to reach a waypoint

[Map visualization showing waypoints]
You'll see a lot of alternative waypoints (yellow) and skipped waypoints (red) on the run map.

• This occurs when Tory reaches its maximum allocated run time and struggles to reach the waypoints on its path

• The 'Quality' in the run data will be very poor. The example run quality is 56% (circled)

• Tory has determined that the poor quality of the run is the cause of the run Timeout

No run map is generated, and the logs don't provide a specific issue

• Aborted runs are the most difficult to troubleshoot due to lack of information received

• Normally caused by a software failure, Tory being switched off during the run or a network issue

• PIA's will work and troubleshoot with Metralabs on aborted runs due to the additional information Metralabs can see for Aborted runs

## Page 33

Scenario 1 continued

Here's what we can tell from the map and what we did to fix it

1. We can tell that TORY spent a lot of time in this area, where it appears to have miss-localised, causing the run to fail / timeout

   a. We need to confirm that Tory isn't getting stuck in a particular area due to congestion

   b. PIA's will continually look to optimise the run, meaning that when this type of failure occurs, they'll work with you to minimise chances of it re-occurring.

## Page 34

Scenario 2

You can instantly tell that something has gone wrong by looking at the outcome of a run, as it's only showing a small part of the overall map.

1. What could have caused this?
   a. Tory got lost
   b. The doors to the shop floor were closed
   c. Tory didn't hit a waypoint

[The image shows a map layout with a red path and a red dot at the end, with black areas representing the mapped space and gray areas appearing to be unexplored or inaccessible regions]

## Page 35

Scenario 3

What do you think happened to cause TORY to not move further from the charging dock?

• You can see TORY has undocked

• There's no door issue

• TORY never made it to a waypoint
