Everseen SCO Technology

Everseen is a SCO technology that has been implemented into selected stores to alert when a no scan, product switch, basket base loss or abandoned transaction occurs on a self-service machine. When detected the system pauses the transaction and provides a video displaying the no scan, product switch or basket base loss occurring so it can be corrected.

Please Note: To protect customer privacy all video footage pixelates the heads/faces of anyone in view and the EFTPOS pinpad is masked so pin numbers can not be identified.

It's important that stores that have this technology training all team members and managers who operate within the SCO area to ensure customers are supported and to get the best use out of the technology.

It is also important that to ensure compliance standards are met that the Everseen signage is clearly displayed for customers to see at the entry of the store near the conditions of entry signage, and another at the entry to the SCOs. Refer to links below.

Information Location: Stores > Profit Protection > Everseen

Important Tips to Get the Highest Performance from Everseen Technology:

Right People in the Right Place
- Ensure you have the right team members who are trained on SCOs & Everseen, can effectively manage queues and know how to investigate every alert.

Check every intervention carefully
- SCO team members must check every intervention to ensure the correct products are scanned. This will reduce your shrink.

Maintain the SCO area
- To keep false alerts to a minimum, ensure the SCO area is clean (receipts, rubbish, products left behind, hangers etc.)

Customer Service
- Assist customers to use the SCO's correctly, help customers who have large quantities of an item to prevent no scans. Blame the system not the person.

System Observations
- If you are not getting alerts on the SCO, if no video is showing, if there is no alerts in the dashboard, raise an INC with the IT service desk immediately.

Check the eDashboard
- Review video transactions in the dashboard weekly to identify opportunities for team member training and check system efficiency.

Receipt Scanner

The receipt scanner is an application on PDT devices within the store application and is to be used by Customer Greeters to scan the barcode of a customer receipt upon exit, to validate the location, date, and time.

These checks must be conducted in conjunction with greeting customer/s upon entry/exit, as well as checking the total number of purchased items on the receipt match the items being taken out of the store. This guide outlines the functions and process for using this application.

Information Link: Receipt Scanner Process Guide (Click Here)

Each time a receipt is scanned for validation the app checks for correct location, date and time displaying an alert to show the types of action required whilst validating receipts and purchases of customers upon exiting a store:

Green Alert = Valid Receipt
- A green alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with a tick and 'Valid Receipt' messaging. This alert validates:
• The receipt has been purchased in your store, with your store number appearing under the green banner on the left side of the screen.
• The items were purchased within 5 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation upon exiting the store appearing under the green banner on the right side of the screen.

Amber Alert = Check Items
- An amber alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with an exclamation mark and 'Check Item's messaging. This alert validates:
• The receipt has been purchased in your store, with your store number appearing under the amber banner on the left side of the screen.
• The items were purchased within 5 to 20 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation upon exiting the store appearing under the amber banner on the right side of the screen.
• This alert requires further checks to validate purchases.

Red Alert = Invalid Receipt
- A red alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with a cross and 'Invalid Receipt' messaging. This alert indicates:
• The receipt is not a purchase from your store, with the store number appearing under the red banner on the left side of the screen. (non-Kmart receipts will not show a number).
• The items were purchased after 20 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation upon exiting the store appearing under the red banner on the right of the screen. This includes different dates to the date the receipt is shown.
• This alert requires further investigation.

Key Service Areas

There are key service areas within your store that can impact your stores shrinkage. This can occur through not rostering the right Team Members in the right places and not providing the required training and coaching to each Team Member. Here are key areas where Team Members can assist in the reduction of shrinkage:

Customer Greeter
The customer greeter role is very important customer service area providing the first and last point for a customer coming into our stores. It's important to make customers feel welcome and assist wherever needed. From a shrink perspective this role plays an integral part within the team:

• Validating receipts by using the receipt scanner on a PDT & also conducting bag checks to match against products on receipts.
• Informing other Team Members if something isn't quite right.
• Informing the team if you see a POI.
• Ensure they are familiar with the Customer Greeter best practice guide.

Self-Serve Checkout
The self-service area is a fast-paced location in the store, and where every customer needs to be engaged as they enter the area. It's important the SCO Operator:

• Constantly patrols the SCO area to be there when customers need assistance.
• Validate red/amber light interventions, observing customer transactions and checking the screen matches what stock is being taken and paid for.
• Everseen stores to ensure all SCOs are always tidy and assisting with interventions, checking items are scanned and paid for.
• Ensure they are familiar with the Self-Service best practice guide.

Fitting Rooms
Fitting rooms are another high traffic area and must always be attended by a Team Member to engage with every customer as they enter. To monitor this area Team Members must:

• Conduct a visual check on how many garments customers take in and out of fitting rooms, also checking for concealments.
• Ensure every changeroom is clean and tidy.
• If the fitting room is unattended, ensure the FR door is locked.

Profit Protection Stock Management

Stocktake Overview

Stocktake is a physical count of almost every product in a Kmart store, to reset inventory records so they match what is on the shop floor. An accurate stocktake is a critical part of the business process each year and is important because:

• It resets our inventory levels across the country.
• Resetting inventory levels means that stock replenishment can be done more accurately by the merchandise team.
• Customers check our stock on hand via Kmart website and shop based on these levels.
• Stock on hand for online orders is updated reducing the number of rejected orders.
• It means store EBIT (profit statements) are up to date reflecting accurate stock levels.
• Accurate stock levels are a required part of Wesformers annual reporting.

It is essential that all Kmart management teams take the time to review all the resources via Kit, such as associated documents and complete relevant LMS online courses, to ensure a complete understanding of the process, to lead and deliver a successful stocktake.

Information Location: Stores > Profit Protection > Stocktake

Stocktake is a large task store teams must complete, for both the preparation and running the Stocktake. Here is a summary of tasks split into these 2 parts of a stocktake.

Stocktake Preparation

• Prepare stocktake folders
• Form 1 (planning product locations)
• Stocktake training (LMS courses, Kit resource documents reviewed, live mock-up training)
• Pre stocktake check ins (for managers who have been with Kmart for 2 years or less)
• IT requirement checks (server reboot, PDT device, wi-fi coverage)
• Rostering
• Receiving management (DC deliveries/ manifests on hold)

Conducting Stocktake Counts & Investigations

• Receiving management (DC deliveries/ manifests on hold)
• Count capture (scanning the stock)
• Form 6 (printing stock count variance reports for investigations)
• Investigations and adjustments (reports, confirm stock counts, review findings, adjust incorrect counts)
• Results review and action planning

Gap Scans

Cyclic gap scans are when a store scans shelf edge labels to check how much stock on hand (SOH) should be available and adjust stock on hand if it is incorrect to address merchandise gaps. Stock on hand is crucial to effective replenishment in stores and when accurate results in:

• Effective and efficient system replenishment of items to the store resulting in increased in stock position.
• Increased sales and profit.
• Improved customer experience through a better range and available stock.
• Simplification of other processes that rely on accurate stock on hand e.g. stocktake.

Information Link: Cyclic Gap Scan (Click Here)

Gaps scans occur weekly, with a full store scan completed every 4 weeks, with schedules located in the Store Task Tool application system. The criteria for cyclic gaps scans are:

Area | Criteria
---|---
SMS integrity | Needs to be at 80% +
Backfill | Completed in the last 24 hours
Gap Scan | Completed by a manager as financial adjustments are made
Manifests | Are up to date
Offsite, Return/Hold bags | Stock is checked
Shop Keeping Cages | Up to date and new lines cut in
Investigations | Are conducted by Managers
MOS Adjustments | Actioned daily

• Completed by a manager preferably in the early morning (7am -10am) when there has been less stock movement.
• Location refresh completed bi-monthly.
• Departments backfilled prior to the gap scan.
• Review other locations where the stock could be held e.g., return bags, hold bags etc.
• Claimable pallet report is printed to identify RLO items still on SOH.
• Online stores to ensure regular dispatching throughout the day for accurate SOH.
• Wait 15 minutes after completing a gap scan to investigate discrepancies.
• Print shrinkage report.
• Review and complete investigations.
• Complete adjustments.
• Print reports and sign off.

Date Coded Merchandise

Date Coded Merchandise are products that have either a best before or use by date that advises how long the product will be at its best flavour and quality. The differences between best before, used by and expiry dates are:

Used By: The date indicates when the product may no longer be safe to consume/use.

Best Before: The date indicates when the quality of the product is at its best. The product can be consumed/used after this date; however, the quality will not be at its best.

Expiry Date: The date indicates when the product may no longer be safe to consume/use.

Information Link: Manage Date Coded Merchandise (Click Here)

It is the responsibility of Kmart Team Members who work in each department with date coded merchandise, to follow the dated merchandise process. This prevents date coded merchandise from being sold out-of-date, infestations and lost profits.

Date coded merchandise that has a date identified 4 weeks before the use by/best before or expiry date are marked down by 50% off the original price to clear the products before the dates expire, then again at 2 weeks down to 75% off the original price.

If a date (best before/used by/expiry) expires the product must be destroyed, disposed of, and adjusted in the system except for Lindt chocolates where the supplier provides rebates.

Stock Adjustments

Stock adjustments occur in stores regularly to maintain an accurate stock on hand (SOH). Stock adjustments are identified through:

• Cyclic Gap Scans
• Known theft
• Stocktake
• Faulty stock that is returned when instruction by National office
• Is written off for store use
• Tory (the RFID robot)

It's important that adjustments are only actioned after investigations have been complete to try and identify if the stock could be accounted for. It also important that store adjust stock as identified through the Mainframe connect system, to ensure SOH is accurate, and with the correct adjustment code to enable accurate reporting of shrinkage.

Information Location: Stores > Profit Protection > Procedures

The adjustment codes relating to Profit Protection are listed below and should be actioned via PDT devices. Refer to the Stock Adjustment Code Guide (Click Here)

Empty Packets

Empty packets are the packaging of products sold within a store, where an item has been removed from the packaging, and the empty packet is then hidden or placed around the store in either obvious or hidden areas.

Identifying empty packets is an indication of theft in a store, and it's important that all Team Members are aware of hot spot areas for empty packets, and what to do if they find them. Some high-volume areas for empty packets include:

• Change rooms (behind mirrors, under fitting room seating).
• Back of the bike units.
• Shed area (home décor).
• Cosmetics area.
• Areas were there isn't much customer traffic.
• Back of house areas e.g., stock room, tea rooms.

Each store is different and will have different keycodes that are identified regularly as an empty packet. It's important to know what the top empty packet keycodes are in your store, so you can all be aware and create a stronger presence in the areas the keycodes are located. This is obtained through the Profit Protection dashboard and weekly/YTD KDW reporting.

Reducing Empty Packets

• Keep your team informed regularly on the results of empty packets located in your store.
• Create a red route and encourage the team to walk these areas during shifts, when leaving the store for a break, or leaving the store at the end of a shift.
• Know your empty packet hotspot areas and encourage the team to frequent these areas.
• If empty packets or anything suspicious is observed report it immediately to a manager.
• Know your stores Persons of Interest (POI), reach out to your Profit Protection Business Partner for assistance.
• Double check if the unwrapped product is nearby.

Empty Packets Bin Setup

It's important that your empty packet bins are set up in the back of house area, so Team Members can place all identified empty packets into them so they can be accounted for and written off using adjustment code 21. Here are a couple of great setup examples to follow:

[Two images showing empty packet bin setups - one with three black bins and another with white storage containers, both labeled for empty packets]

Kmart Profit Protection Store Leadership Guide - August 2025 V13                                                                    26

## Page 27

Kmart Profit Protection Store Leadership Guide

Store should setup empty packet bins by world, and place signage provided on each bin to clearly identify the world for each bin. It is then the responsibility of the world managers to review the empty packets in their area and write them off using adjustment code 21 on a weekly basis.

Information Link: Empty Packets & Glass Breakage Process (Click Here)

When you Locate Empty Packets

Step | Who | Action

Step 1 | All Team Members | An empty packet is identified. Remove the empty packet/s from where you locate them, and double check the area to see if the product that matches the wrapper is in the general area.

Step 2 | All Team Members | Take the empty packets to a manager and report:
- Where you located the empty packets?
- Did you see anything suspicious?
- The time you located the empty packets.
- Provide the empty packets identified.

Info: It's important to give as much detail as possible to your manager when empty packets are located, so they can potentially refer to CCTV footage

Step 3 | Manager | Notes down the details reported by the Team Member in step 2 and places the empty packets into the relevant world empty packet bins.

Step 4 | Manager | Communicates at team huddles high volume empty packet locations to create awareness and encourages the team to patrol these areas to deter offenders from repeating the offence.

Step 5 | Manager | Ensures empty packets are adjusted using code 21, weekly (if a high-volume store complete daily)

Info: Talk to your Profit Protection Business Partner for further information

Manifests

A manifest is a list of items that have been recorded within Kmart stock management systems that are sent to your store for delivery. They are used to check that deliveries are accurate. There are some different types of manifests and reporting to assist with stock management which include:

Manifest Type | Description
---|---
DC Manifest | A listing of deliveries that have been despatched from the DC but have not yet been receipted.
Outstanding Manifest Report | An outstanding manifest is a list of all shipments that have been dispatched by the DC but have not yet been receipted at store.
House Manifest | Deliveries that have been sent to the store and receipted.
Damaged Manifest | A list of damaged deliveries.

Tip | Action
---|---
Conduct routine checks on load verses manifest | • Check all consolidation numbers on pallets and FB2s off the manifest before it is receipted.<br>• Using the PDT, scan barcode on the right top corner and write the date on when it was receipted.<br>• If consolidations do not match the manifest or another stores stock has been mixed up in the load email the DC immediately.
Investigate house manifests | • Check keycodes prior to receipting a house manifest to ensure the stock has been receipted.<br>• Confirm total stock on hand equals MR and amount store is manifested for then receipt the House Manifest.<br>• If it has been identified that the stock on the house manifest is not in store, advise the DC immediately.<br>• Check house manifests daily until confirmed stock has arrived in store<br>• Once confirmed stock has arrived in store receipt the house manifest
Check outstanding manifests | • Use the Power Bi Report for outstanding manifests to identify and action. Review this report daily.<br>• Investigate all outstanding manifest more than 2 weeks.<br>• Perform a SOH check to the system for 20 keycodes in a manifest.<br>• Escalate all issues to the DC help desk to seek advice as to where the manifest is.
Damaged manifests | • Ensure damaged manifests are receipted.<br>• Adjust stock using Code 8 – damaged at receiving via a PDT and attach to the damaged manifest. File documents once completed.<br>• This will ensure your stock integrity is correct.

Based on the scenario, the Keyholder is advised on the next steps and to attend the site. If a situation arises, it is important that from a safety perspective that the manager/keyholder wait for the Police/security for assistance.

Scenarios include:
• Multiple alarms activated – Police and keyholder contacted to attend.
• Alarm not turned off at close – Keyholder contacted to attend.
• Keyholder unable to attend – If for safety concerns or tiredness the security company will contact the next keyholder on the list and will keep going through the list until a keyholder listed confirms they can attend.

EAS Gates

Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) Gates are placed at the entry of every store. The EAS gates are systems that detect products that have EAS labels/tags/devices attached to them when they pass through the gates.

EAS labels/tags/devices stay connected with the stores EAS system and trigger an alarm sound if they pass the EAS gates without being properly deactivated. The alarm will also activate in the event a EAS labels/tags/devices is forcefully removed from the product if it is not properly deactivated.

Stores must ensure gates are tested daily, to ensure they are in working order and log any issues via Facilities.

Refunds

Kmart process refunds for customer every day for orders/products in circumstances where an order is missing an item, the item is faulty/damaged, or the customer has changed their mind. It's important that every refund is checked carefully before and while being processed using the guidelines outlined in this guide, to ensure the customer's refund or return is processed correctly in line with the Kmart Returns Policy

Information Links: Kmart Return Policy (Click Here)

Refunds MUST be Issued Using the Original Payment Method

• Refunds must be made to the original payment method.

• This can be identified by looking at the bottom of the receipt presented.

• For card payments refer to the last four digits and ensure they match the last four digits on the card the customer presents for the refund.

• In this example the customer paid with a NAB savings account card and the last four digits to compare are 4893.

• If the customer is unable to provide the card that matches the original purchase, an Exchange Evoucher may be issued.

PLEASE NOTE: Digital receipts are now available for customers who sign up to the Kmart app. Customers may present for a refund using this digital receipt.
Digital receipts will display the last three digits of the card used in the original transaction, however if you scan the receipt the last four digits of the card used in the original transaction will appear at the top right of the POS screen. Ensure this number matches the card the refund is being placed onto, to ensure the refund is paid to the original payment method.

POS Prompt: A prompt will display at POS when performing a refund to an EFT account. When 'cards' is selected as a tender, a message pop up box appears with 'Match last four digits of card/digital wallet with receipt'.

Kmart Profit Protection Store Leadership Guide

Refunds Without a Receipt
Refunds without a proof of purchase cannot be issued unless the product is faulty.
As a result, we no longer require the capture of customer ID.

Split Payment Refunds
• Same as single type of payment – split refunds must issue using the original payment methods.
• For card payments refer to the last four digits match the last four digits on the card the customer presents for the refund.
• In this example a savings account was used with four digits 7167, and a gift card.
• Gift cards cannot be refunded.
• Do not process an online refund any other way to avoid duplicate refunds (CSC have no visibility to refunds processed outside this process and this could result in duplicate refunds being received).

Online Refunds
• Online refunds can only be refunded by the original payment method.
• Use the POS 'Lookup' function to search for online order refunds, or by scanning the barcode on the customer's invoice.
• View the original transaction details to check that none of the items have been previously refunded.
• Once the online refund is completed through POS it will be credited back onto the customer's account the purchase was made onto.

Gift Card & Exchange Voucher Refunds
Gift cards and exchange vouchers cannot be refunded once purchased. Gift cards and exchange vouchers are not redeemable for cash as outlined in the terms and conditions of these cards.
If a customer returns an item paid for with a gift card or returns voucher, they can only receive the value of the refund back as an exchange voucher.

Apple/Google Pay Refunds
• The customer needs to present the card within their digital wallet from their mobile device, with the device number that is listed on the receipt.
• For this type of payment refer to the last four digits on the receipt and match them to the last four digits displayed on the digital card.
• In this example the receipt needs to show the last four digits as 3318.

Faulty Refunds & Returns

If a product is presented for a return or refund that is faulty or not of acceptable quality, customer can request a refund, exchange voucher or repair of the item. For refunds the customer will need to provide one of the following proof of purchase:

It is the responsibility of each Store Manager to ensure:
• The 'After-Hours Alarm Call Out List' is always kept up to date as changes occur in the team
• The list has a minimum of 4 key holders listed
• The updated lists are emailed to the security company AUS = billing.aus@chubb-sharedservices.com or NZ special.projects@smc.com.au

Multiple Alarms Activated:
The security monitoring centre (SMC) will contact a key holder if there is a multiple alarm, a perimeter door alarm activation, or a confirmed break and enter. The key holder is required to attend the store and allow access for the Police.

Alarm Not Turned on At Close:
If a key holder is contacted due to an alarm not being turned on at the time of closing, they are required to attend the store and turn the alarm on.

Non-Trade Day Cash Process

Prior to lockup on a non-trade day e.g., on Christmas and New Years Day, stores must ensure the following checks are actioned to ensure the store is secure:

Task | Action

Cash Machine Stores
• Ensure the note acceptor in non-recycling SCOs or cash boxes are cleared and deposit the money into the cash machine against the applicable SCO.
• The cash box is required to be emptied to clear excess notes, after the store has closed its doors on the day before a non-trade day e.g., Christmas eve (24th December).

BNR SCOs
• Print a cash status report, remove and reset the cash box and clear the contents to the cash machine.
• Recycle cassettes can remain secured in the SCO.
• Ensure all cash is secured in the vault, including register drawers and clearance.

K Hub Stores
• On the next day of trade, ensure all transactions are entered into CMS and a full vault count is conducted.
• If transactions are entered in on a Tuesday/Wednesday for the previous week, you may need to contact the IT Service Desk team, to refresh the transaction data.

SCO Cash Removal (Non-Cash Machine Stores)
• To secure the cash in your non-recycling self-checkouts, you are required to remove your note canisters from each self-checkout unit and store them in the vault (or in the absence of a vault, a tank safe), whilst the store is closed (e.g., on Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Day, where applicable).
• Ensure the following is actioned the day prior to non-trade e.g., Christmas or New Year's Eve:
    ○ Ensure each of the canisters is numbered i.e., register 81 to ensure it is returned to the correct self-service checkout.
    ○ Prior to removal, print out a 'Cash Status Report' for each self-checkout.
    ○ Swap out the Note Acceptor and empty the Coin Overflow for each self-service checkout. When removing the note acceptor, check it is numbered with the register number to avoid confusion.
    ○ Please make sure each self-service checkout is closed after completing this task.
    ○ After the store has closed its doors on the day prior to non-trade e.g., Christmas Eve (24th December), 2 people are required to remove the note canisters from each self-service checkout. Do not remove any coins from the hoppers (these can remain in each self-checkout).
    ○ The note canisters can be transported from each self-service checkout to the cash office vault, cash machine or tank safe and stored securely.

SCO Cash Setup (Non-Cash Machine Stores)
• Opening after a no trade day e.g., Boxing Day/New Year's Day:
    ○ Prior to store opening its doors, remove the canisters from the secure location and transport them back to the self-service checkout area.
    ○ Place each canister in the applicable self-service checkout.
    ○ Print out a 'Cash Status Report' for each self-service checkout.
• Ensure the 'Note Acceptor' and 'Coin Overflow' totals have been reset to zero, if both are empty.

Info
• For stores who do not have an adequate secure location, please leave the canisters in each SCO, you are not required to action the above steps.

Managing Requests for CCTV Requests

There may be instances when the business is contacted, with a request for a copy of CCTV footage, e.g., Police for footage of an incident. CCTV footage is protected by the Privacy Act, it is important that the correct steps are followed, to ensure that we are operating within the scope of the Privacy Act, whilst assisting with these types of requests.

Please note this process applies to CCTV cameras within all stores and the body worn safety cameras on trial in selected stores.

Request for CCTV Footage Process

Step | Action

Scenario 1
When an incident occurs in a store and Police/law enforcement request footage, it should be provided as soon as possible. Preferably using Auror or Police Portal links located in this guide.
PLEASE NOTE: This type of request does not require approval to issue.

Scenario 2
If an incident occurs outside of the store and Police/law enforcement request footage a written/email request from the requestor, with the following details:
• Reason for the request for the footage (e.g., for Police to investigate a criminal matter)
• Date and time of the offence that occurred
• Summary of the nature of offence/incident
Once this written/email request has been obtained, forward the information via email to compliance@kmart.com.au. The compliance team will review the request and will then provide approval/rejection for the store concerned to release the requested CCTV footage.

Scenario 3
If an incident occurs within or outside of a store and person/s other than police/law enforcement request footage e.g.
• Third party suppliers (unless authorised by the Kmart Profit Protection & Compliance teams)
• Contractors (including security guards)
• Customers
• Centre Management
The store must obtain the requestors details and reasons for requiring the footage and email it to compliance@kmart.com.au. The compliance team will review the request and will then provide approval/rejection for the store concerned to release the requested CCTV footage.

Scenario 4
We should never release footage to the public upon request. If this occurs stores should respond to such a request by stating that the person will need to engage a lawyer to access CCTV footage.
If this occurs, please contact the Kmart Compliance Team via the mailbox on compliance@kmart.com.au. The Compliance team will provide instructions to the store to pass onto the requestor in this circumstance.

Info
Kmart Team Members/Managers must not provide any of the details of the compliance team with the person/s e.g., Police (email, phone etc.). This includes sharing the compliance@kmart.com.au email address.
