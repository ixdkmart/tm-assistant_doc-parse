Everseen SCO Technology Guide

SCO Technology is a software program applied to self-serve machines, which detects any of the alerts listed below triggering an intervention and providing the SCO team member a video to detect what has not been scanned correctly.

• No Scans - when a customer has missed scanning an item.
• Basket Base Loss (BBL) - when a customer leaves in basket and not included in transaction.
• Product Switch - when a customer switches an item barcode.

No Scans & Basket Base Loss Intervention Process

Step | Action

Step 1
The customer is transacting on a SCO and one of the follow instances occurs:
• No Scans (when a customer has missed scanning an item).
• Basket Base Loss (when a customer left item/s in their basket and starts to complete the transactions).

Step 2
The SCO will trigger an intervention that requires a SCO team member to help resolve. The SCO team member needs to scan their operator barcode to view and investigate the next screen.

At the top of the screen lists the type of intervention i.e. No Scan or Basket Base Loss. The screen also displays a video to show what item has not been scanned correctly which will also have a green box around the item to highlight it.

Step 4
The SCO team member must investigate every transaction carefully:
• Refer to the top of the screen to see what alert type has been triggered e.g. Mis-scanned item.
• Review the video to identify the cause.
• Check the list of items scanned on the POS screen against what is in the bagging area, to ensure all items are scanned correctly.
• Ensure the SCO areas are clean so rubbish etc. don't trigger interventions.
• Multiple interventions can be a sign of theft.
• Know your top 10 product switch products (refer to the Shrink VMB)
• Blame the machine not the person e.g. for some reason the scanner didn't scan the item, let me rescan it for you.

Info
SCO team members must watch the video for every intervention to detect why the intervention was triggered.

Step 5
When the issue has been detected the team member should assist the customer by rescanning any items that were not scanned correctly.

Info
Which button do I select?
Rescan Item:
• When a Kmart product has not been scanned and creates an alert (no scan, BBL or product switch).
Rescan not required:
• When a Kmart product triggers an alert but has already been scanned and displayed on the SCO screen.
• When a non-Kmart item triggers an alert (hangers, phones, coffee cups, products from other retailers)
• When a Kmart product triggers an alert because the system identifies a product that has multiple parts as multiple products e.g. container with a lid

Step 6
Once the intervention alert has been reviewed and resolved, the customer can proceed with their transaction.

Product Switch Process
Product switch is an alert triggered when a customer switches a different product barcode when scanning a product to pay a cheaper price for the item. Customer may try this by:
• Using a barcode sticker of a cheaper item and placing on the barcode of a more expensive item.
• Using a smaller item e.g. confectionary and placing on the barcode of a more expensive item.
• Printing barcodes of a cheaper item and placing on the barcode of a more expensive item.
Some customers may place these barcodes on the product or hide them in their hands or on their phone to conceal it.

How does product switch work?
• We have provided Everseen with a list of products we know and estimate customers will use for a product switch. Not every item in the store is a registered product switch item.
• To register an item we provide Everseen with the product barcode and description. The system then learns the product when scanned by customers learning how the product looks at each angle.
• Once the technology learns the product it is placed into go live mode and will trigger an alert if used in a product switch.
This list is available on Kit. If you know of other items to be added please email lplossbox lplossbox@kmart.com.au with the product barcode and description and we will have it added.

Step 1
Action: Customer uses a barcode for a cheaper item to scan a more expensive item (in this example Colgate toothpaste is used to scan a bottle of night wash). This triggers an intervention. The SCO team member needs to scan their operator barcode to view and investigate the next screen.

Step 2
At the top of the screen lists the type of intervention i.e. Product Switch. The screen also displays a video to show the product switch occurring which will also have a green box around the item to highlight it.

Step 3
The SCO team member must investigate every transaction carefully:
• Refer to the top of the screen to see what alert type has been triggered e.g. Product Switch
• Review the video to identify the cause.
• Check the list of items scanned on the POS screen to identify what items have been scanned incorrectly.
• Ensure the SCO areas are clean so rubbish etc. don't trigger interventions.
• Multiple interventions can be a sign of theft.
• Know your top 10 product switch products (refer to the Shrink VMB)

Info
Blame the machine not the person e.g. for some reason the scanner didn't scan the item, left me rescan it for you.
SCO team members must watch the video for every intervention to detect why the intervention was triggered.

Step 4
Rescan the product switch item using the correct barcode, and check all other items scanned have been scanned correctly.

Step 6
Once the intervention alert has been reviewed and resolved, the customer can proceed with their transaction.

Customer Service Examples
It is important that every customer is provided with great service and is never accused of any wrongdoing. Missed scans can be accidental and each case should be treated the same. Always remember to follow the 4D's if faced with a threatening situation and notify your manager as soon as possible. Managing Threatening Situations - 4Ds Poster

Scenario | Team Member Response

A customer is at a SCO and has already had an intervention for not scanning an item. The customer doesn't scan another item creating another intervention. | Team Member responds to the intervention alert by approaching the SCO:
"Hi how are you today. It looks like an item didn't scan through. I'll clear this so you can re-scan the item".

A customer is at the SCO and has scanned a different barcode to the product scanned. | Team Member responds to the intervention alert by approaching the SCO:
"Hi how are you today. It looks like the item didn't scan properly. I'll clear this so you can re-scan the item".

How to Get the Best Results from Everseen

Right People in the Right Place | Ensure you have the right team members who are trained on SCOs & Everseen, can effectively manage queues and know how to investigate every alert.

Check every intervention carefully | SCO team members must check every intervention to ensure the correct products are scanned. This will reduce your shrink.

Maintain the SCO area | To keep false alerts to a minimum, ensure the SCO area is clean (receipts, rubbish, products left behind, hangers etc.)

Customer Service | Assist customers to use the SCO's correctly, help customers who have large quantities of an item to prevent no scans. Blame the system not the person.

System Observations | If you are not getting alerts on the SCO, if no video is showing, if there is no alerts in the dashboard, raise an INC with the IT service desk immediately.
