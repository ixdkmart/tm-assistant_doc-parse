Social Q - Virtual Queue

To commence using Social Q you will need the following:
1. PDT/Tablet/Store Mobile Phone
2. Pen
3. Raffle Tickets

The 5 large Tri Signs will always need to be strategically positioned out the front of store displaying 'Don't want to Queue'.

Once the store/physical queue hits capacity the queue controller will flip the double-sided Tri Signs to 'Store at Capacity collect required equipment and commence a Virtual Queue using Social Q.

The queue manager will use raffle tickets for those customers that do not have a phone

Upon the next customer arriving inform them the store/physical queue is at capacity and they must join the virtual queue/book via Social Q to enter. There are two options for the customer to choose when using Social Q
• Now (Walk Up and join the queue)
• Later (Booking to come back)

If the customer is a Walk Up and wants to join the virtual queue, they scan the QR code or enter the web address on one of the Tri Signs and wait to be notified via SMS

If the customer books for later, they book their time slot that they wish to attend, at a later time, then leave and come back at the date and time they booked.

If the customer does not have access to a phone, the team member can add a booking on the customers behalf by pressing add booking.
Add the customer's name and the raffle ticket number into the name field, leave mobile number blank. Then issue raffle ticket to customer. The customer then will need to wait nearby for when their raffle ticket number is called.
