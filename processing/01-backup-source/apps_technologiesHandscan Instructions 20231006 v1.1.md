Handscan / Save & Finalise

1. Open the RFID App, select the 'Count Capture' tile

2. Scroll through left to right the 'Storage selection' until you find the Container you wish to handscan into

3. Start hand scanning by pulling the trigger on the RFID wand & watch the EPC tag count capture increase as new tags are recognised. The hand scan will only recognise NEW tags (tags that have not been read by the Tory Robot)

4. When you've captured all the tags, press 'FINALISE' (If at any point you realise you have accidentally been scanning into the wrong container, press the 'reset' button to start again)

5. Press 'YES'

6. From the home screen, select the 'Inventory Summary' tile

7. If the 'SAVE & FINALISE' button appears greyed out, (EPC tags are still processing in the background) pull down the screen to refresh until the button appears 'clickable'

8. Press the 'SAVE & FINALISE' button

9. Press 'YES, CONTINUE' to confirm.

Backfill tasks should generate after approx. 10 minutes
