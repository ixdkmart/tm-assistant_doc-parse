RECALL NOTICES

What is it for?
Product Recall Notices are issued to ensure the safety of Kmart customers and team members. Once a product has been upgraded to Recall a 'Store Communication' is added to Kit (and stores notified of the communication) and a public notice is to be placed at the front of the store and in the area that the product would normally be located.

Notices should be printed in the format they appear on KIT, i.e. they should not be scaled down in size or amended in any way.

Copies are then also placed onto on the KIT site to ensure you can access the Notice at all times.

If the store copy is removed for any reason before the 'Remove on' date is reached you can reprint from this site.

Where do I find them?
Recall Notices are filed on KIT in the Resources section at Stores > Merchandise > Compliance > Current Product Recalls:
