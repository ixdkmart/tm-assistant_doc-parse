Loss Prevention Team Talk

Loss Prevention Awareness

Delivered by: Store Leadership Team at the daily huddle.
Delivered to: All Kmart Store Team Members.
Team Talk Topic: LP Awareness: Reporting suspicious behaviour & understanding the consequences.

Internal theft and fraud is on the rise at Kmart, resulting in an increase of investigations into instances in theft of merchandise and/or cash, fraudulent transactions such as refunds and gift cards, through to breaches in the code of conduct with the misuse of Flybuys and team member discounts.

It's important that everyone is constantly aware and report any instances of this type of activity, whilst also understanding the consequences:

Look out for signs of suspicious behaviour:
• If something looks out of place such as products or parcels being left in unusual locations.
• Empty packets (including back of house areas).
• Witnessing a theft occurring.
• Leaving the store with stock that has not been paid for.
• Leaving a store without bags being checked.

Report suspicious behaviour:
• We know majority of our team live by our values and do the right thing. However, if you see something suspicious or unusual, please report this to your manager or confidentially report this through our Speak Up service.
• All matters raised are kept confidential, protecting those who raise concerns or allegations.

Ways to speak up:
• Talk to your line manager or store manager.
• Online: https://kmart.com.au/speakup
• Phone (AUS): 1800 518 230 or (NZ): 0800 753 231.

Internal theft & fraud of any kind is a serious crime.
Loss Prevention have serious monitoring measures to identify internal theft & fraud, with serious consequences that may include:
• Termination of employment.
• Legal consequences (police may be involved, charges laid & you may have to go to court).
• Criminal convictions that could impact future employment, restrict overseas travel, completion of studies.
• Impacts to your fellow colleagues, family & friends.
• Made to pay back what was stolen (restitution).
• You could be banned from entering a Kmart store.
