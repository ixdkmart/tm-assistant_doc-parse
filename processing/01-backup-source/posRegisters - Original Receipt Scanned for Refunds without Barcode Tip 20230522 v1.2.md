REFUNDS ORIGINAL RECEIPT SCANNING TIP

How do I scan the original receipt if the customer has torn off the barcode?

The barcode number can be manually entered from the transaction detail at the top of the receipt.

[Receipt example shown from Kmart Kardinya with transaction details]

The correct format to enter is:
27 [Store Number] [Register Number in two digits] [Transaction Number] [Check Digit]

Note: The check digit can be entered as any number.

Alternatively, the longer form of the bar code can be entered:

[Table format:]
EXAMPLE | 012 | 1024 | 39 | 2958 | 141110 | 1643 | 715 | 000300

TEMPLATE | 012 | STORE | REGISTER | TRANSACTION | DATE (YYMMDD) | TIME (24hr clock) | OPERATOR | VALUE (max 6 digits)
