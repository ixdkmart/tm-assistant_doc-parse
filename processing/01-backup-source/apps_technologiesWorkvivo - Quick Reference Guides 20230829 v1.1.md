Finding your Space
There are so many fun and handy spaces to discover and join - from community groups for like-minded individuals, to spots to ask questions and share your opinions. Scroll to the far right of the Spaces menu at the top to explore 'All Spaces'.

How to request a new Space
In the future, Workvivo will have more Spaces for special interest groups. If you'd like to suggest a new Space for all Kmart team members, please contact the Corporate Affairs team. We welcome all interesting and engaging Space ideas.

You can also request your own private/hidden Space at any time - this is a Space that's not searchable on Workvivo. You will need to provide a reason for the Space showing how it serves a business purpose.

A new Space can be requested through the desktop version of Workvivo:
• Go to the Explore menu
• Click Spaces
• Click on Request New Space in the top right corner

Need more help?
The Workvivo Help Centre is a fantastic resource where you can ask questions and locate a detailed answer, where screenshots of the platform help make the instructions easy to follow. You'll be an expert in no time!

For any other questions, or to share your feedback on the platform, don't hesitate to contact Kmart Team Communications via Kmart.StaffCommunications@kmart.com.au

Space Owners and Administrators

Spaces are communities within Workvivo

A centralised location for communication related to a specific topic, for example:
Health & Wellbeing, Life at Kmart, Pride, and First Nations. Every Store and Distribution Centre has its own dedicated Store or DC Space, which is run by Store Managers and DC Managers and supported by their leadership teams.

As a Space Owner or Administrator, you commit to:

Managing Space access as new team members will be automatically added to your Store or DC Space via our Active Directory, and you will have the role of promoting others to the role of Space Administrator when required.

Appointing a Moderator to support content moderation activities.

Regularly posting new and varied content, valuable information, updates and good news stories through events, articles, posts, and documents.

Revisiting the Space description periodically, ensuring it aligns with your space vision (not required for Store or DC Spaces).

Reviewing Space analytics (e.g., number of visitors, top creators and contributors) to inform future content.

Hot tip: Plan a content calendar for each month.

Top tips for building your Space

• Utilise polls, shout-outs and calls to action to encourage engagement with your content.

• Pin content that you want to promote to the top of the Space for a limited period of time.

• Post a featured update with a great cover image, and make sure the imagery in your posts is high quality.

• Invite other team members who you know would be interested in joining your Space (this does not apply to Store or DC Spaces as membership of these Spaces is automated).

• Seek feedback from members regularly about the content that is being shared.

• Promote collaboration, knowledge sharing and networking across Kmart by tagging your team in your posts and comments.

Here are handy tips to help you create quick content that's inspiring and uniquely you!

Topics to talk about
We have specific Spaces to centralise discussions on certain topics (e.g., Health & Wellbeing, Pride, First Nations), however, what you choose to post is up to you!

Here are some thought starters:
- Link to a useful resource.
- Post a bite-sized news update.
- Pose a question or provocation.
- Tell a customer story.
- Profile a team member or personal story (ask for permission first).
- Promote an event or wellbeing program.
- Conduct an interview with a team member.
- Project spotlights and updates.
- Start a competition.
- Ask for feedback.

How to take great photos, selfies, and videos

We want you to look your best but remember...authenticity and just being you is what makes the best content and will resonate most with the Kmart team. But for those budding photographers and filmmakers out there, here are some tips to make content that cuts through.

Check your camera lens. Give it a quick wipe to remove any fingerprints or debris.

Lighting is key! Good lighting can significantly enhance the quality of your photo or video. Whenever possible, shoot in well-lit environments or utilise natural light. If necessary, adjust your device's exposure settings to improve visibility.

Steady and stable shots. To achieve stable shots, hold your mobile device with both hands (when filming) or consider using a tripod or stabiliser.

Clean and clear audio. This is essential for an engaging video experience. Reduce background noise by recording in a quiet environment. Position your device closer to the audio source, such as the speaker or the subject speaking, to capture better sound. Additionally, consider using an external microphone if you want to improve audio quality further.

Edit or filter your shots (but don't overdo it!). Don't be scared to use your mobile device's editing software to crop, filter or brighten your shots.

Don't be afraid of the candid shot! A behind-the-scenes feel is genuine and relatable.

[Speech bubble: "Try not overdo applying filters. Keep your images authentic!"]

[Speech bubble: "Have a look around and join the conversation!"]

Finally, before pressing 'post'...
□ Have you re-read your post to make sure it's accurate, free of spelling / grammar mistakes and that it makes sense to the reader?
□ Does your post comply with our terms and conditions? Is it in line with our Workplace Behaviour Policy and Code of Conduct?
□ Is your post short and succinct to maximise engagement?
□ Have you attached an image to make your post stand out?
□ Have you included a call to action or a prompt to continue the discussion?
□ Is your message aligned to our desired tone of voice?
□ Do any tags or links that you've included work?
□ Are you posting your message in the correct Space or to the relevant audience?
□ Are you posting your message at an appropriate time to maximise engagement?
□ Are you ready to actively monitor your post's performance and respond to comments in a timely manner?
