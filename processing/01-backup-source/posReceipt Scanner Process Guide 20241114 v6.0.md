Receipt Scanner Process Guide

A new function has been added to store PDT devices within the store application called the 'Receipt Scanner' and is to be used by Customer Greeters to scan the barcode of a customer receipt upon exit, to validate the location, date, and time.

These checks must be conducted in conjunction with greeting customer/s upon entry/exit, as well as checking the total number of purchased items on the receipt match the items being taken out of the store. This guide outlines the functions and process for using this application.

Receipt Scanner App Alert Types

Each time a receipt is scanned for validation the app checks for correct location, date and time displaying an alert to show the types of action required whilst validating receipts and purchases of customers upon exiting a store:

Green Alert = Valid Receipt
- A green alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with a tick and 'Valid Receipt' messaging. This alert validates:
  • The receipt has been purchased in your store, with your store number appearing under the green banner on the left side of the screen.
  • The items were purchased within 5 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation upon exiting the store appearing under the green banner on the right side of the screen.

Amber Alert = Check Items
- An amber alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with an exclamation mark and 'Check Item's' messaging. This alert validates:
  • The receipt has been purchased in your store, with your store number appearing under the amber banner on the left side of the screen.
  • The items were purchased within 5 to 20 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation upon exiting the store appearing under the amber banner on the right side of the screen.
  • This alert requires further checks to validate purchases.

Red Alert = Invalid Receipt
- A red alert displays as a banner at the bottom of the screen with a cross and 'Invalid Receipt' messaging. This alert indicates:
  • The receipt is not a purchase from your store, with the store number appearing under the red banner on the left side of the screen. (non-Kmart receipts will not show a number).
  • The items were purchased after 20 minutes of presenting the receipt for validation upon exiting the store appearing under the red banner on the right of the screen. This includes different dates to the date the receipt is shown.
  • This alert requires further investigation.

How to Use the Receipt Scanner App

Step | Actions

Step 1
Every Customer Greeter must be provided with a fully charged PDT device at the beginning of their shift to use the Receipt Scanner via the Store app.

Step 2
Log into the PDT device and select the 'Store' app > Customer Services, then select the 'Receipt Scanner' option.

Info
The primary tasks a Customer Greeter should conduct in conjunction with this app are greeting customer/s upon entry/exit, and bag checks, as per the Kmart bag check process.

Step 3
As customers approach to exit the store, ask to scan their receipt. Scan the barcode on the bottom of the receipt.

Info
The receipt scanner will only validate the location, date and time of purchase. This check must also be supported by checking the total number of items purchased on the receipt against the number of Kmart items purchased being taken out of the store. This is located in the middle of the receipt in bold text (see red circle in step 3).

Step 4
Review the alert that displays on the screen and manage each alert as required (refer to the next page for scenarios on how to manage each alert).

Info
Customers with the Kmart app, now have access to a digital receipt, however a printed version will also be provided. If a customer presents with a digital receipt scan the barcode as you would the paper version and complete the same checks as above.

Managing Receipt Scanner Alerts

Each alert requires a different action from the Customer Greeter. Below are examples of each scenario and how to advise and conduct conversations with customers.
Always remember to follow the 4D's if faced with a threatening situation and notify your manager as soon as possible. Managing Threatening Situations - 4Ds Poster

Alert Type | Customer Greeter Actions

Green Alert:
1. As customer/s approaches the exit, say "Hello" and request to see their receipt e.g., "Hello, May I please scan your receipt".
2. Scan the barcode at the bottom of the receipt.
3. If a green alert displays, check that the products in the customers possession/bags match what is on the receipt.
4. Once all checks completed provide the customer with a farewell greeting e.g., "Have a great day".

Amber Alert:
1. As customer/s approaches the exit, say "Hello" and request to see their receipt e.g., "Hello, May I please scan your receipt".
2. Scan the barcode at the bottom of the receipt.
3. If an amber alert displays, check that the products in the customers possession/bags match what is on the receipt.
4. If items in the customers possession are not listed on the receipt, alert the customer so they can return to the registers to pay for the item/s.
5. Once all checks completed provide the customer with a farewell greeting e.g., "Have a great day".

Red Alert:
1. As customer/s approach the exit, say "Hello" and request to see their receipt e.g., "Hello, May I please scan your receipt".
2. Scan the barcode at the bottom of the receipt.
3. If a red alert displays, check the following:
   • Store listed is your store (name and number)
   • The date of purchase
   • The time of the purchase
4. Ask the customer "Are you sure this is the correct receipt as it doesn't appear to match the products you have purchased today".

Allow the customer to check and provide the correct receipt or explain the reason for why the receipt is different.
If the situation escalates in any way call a manager immediately to assist, and always follow the 5D's.

Info:
An amber or red alert may not always be malicious, and there can be instances where a red alert occurs that is not an issue and just needs clarification such as:
• A customer who has brought in a receipt from another store/date/time to get a refund/exchange.
• Some customers may be delayed in exiting a store after a purchase in instances such as purchasing photos.
To identify these instances simply check receipts, check the items and ask questions.

Safety
Always remember to follow the 4D's if faced with a threatening situation and notify your manager as soon as possible. Managing Threatening Situations - 4Ds Poster

It's important you take care of your self whilst performing this task in the customer greeter role with these tips which are also covered in your manual handling training:
• Before your shift make sure you warm up as per the war up exercises listed in the Warm-Up's Poster (Click Here)
• Try to rotate your hands when scanning, to avoid repetition.
• Talk to your manager about taking breaks

What If Scenarios

Scenario | Actions

There are a lot of tasks to perform as a customer greeter. Which tasks should I prioritise? | Customer Greeters must ensure that every customer who enters and exits a store is greeted, it brings a positive customer experience and shows customers have your attention and focus. This is to be conducted in conjunction with scanning receipts and bag checks. To be able to prioritise these tasks you can try having the Customer Greeter placed into the middle of the entry/exit.

There is a queue of customers who need receipts to be validated. What should I do? | Queues are not to form. Use your push to talk device and ask for assistance and move customers through quickly to avoid queues.

IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT NOTE: | All Customer Greeters must be trained on how to use the Receipt Scanner app.

Customers are asking about the application and why it is used. What can I say? | It's important that we are open about this process to customers, to help them understand why we do these checks.
Keep the explanation simple e.g.:
"We scan receipts to validate purchases made in the store".

A customer is refusing to have their receipt scanned, what should I do. | Always remember to follow the 4D's if faced with a threatening situation and notify your manager as soon as possible. Managing Threatening Situations - 4Ds Poster

A Customer Threatening Situation occurs, what should I do. | As above contact a manager immediately and follow the 4D's. Make sure the incident is reported immediately into SolvSafety.

If we identify stock being left or dumped at the entry because of customers identifying they will be detected through this updated process, should we report it? | Yes. Use the LP Incident forms to report these instances and provide to your manager to enter into Auror.

A customer presents with a digital receipt. | Digital Kmart receipts are available to Kmart customers who sign up to the Kmart app. Customers will still receive a paper receipt, however if they present a digital receipt upon exit, scan the barcode and follow the same process as you would for the paper receipts.
