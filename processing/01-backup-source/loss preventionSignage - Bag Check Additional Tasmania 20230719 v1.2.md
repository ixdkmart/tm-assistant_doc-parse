Bag Check
Code of Conduct
Summary Statement
Rights and Obligations
of Customers

This statement is a summary of the rights and obligations of customers under the Tasmanian Bag Check Code of Conduct issued by the Director of Consumer Affairs and Fair Trading.

Rights
› You have the right to know before entry that the store conducts bag checks.
› You have the right to refuse interference with your person or with your bags. Checking means that store personnel can look, but not touch. You can be asked to assist during the check, e.g. by removing any obstruction to visual inspection.
› A shopkeeper shall not check a personal handbag unless it is larger than the size of a sheet of A4 paper (i.e. 297mm x 210mm) or they are certain that the handbag conceals goods which have not been paid for and are the property of the shopkeeper.

Obligations
› Having entered a store knowing that bag checks are conducted, you have accepted the store's right to ask you to open your bags for checking.

Important notes
› If you refuse a check of your bags you can be asked to leave the store and not return.
› Other bags, cartons, parcels and containers that could reasonably be expected to conceal goods may be checked.
› If you feel that the Bag Check Code of Conduct has been breached, you should contact the management of the retailer.
› If the retailer is unable to resolve your issues then contact Consumer, Building and Occupation Services (CBOS) at www.cbos.tas.gov.au or on 1300 65 44 99.
