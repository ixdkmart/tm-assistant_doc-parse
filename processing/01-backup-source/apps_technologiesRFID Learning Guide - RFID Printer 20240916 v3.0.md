FAQ's and troubleshooting continued

The small calibration has stopped happening when I turn on the printer, is this right?
There should always be a small calibration when you turn on the printer

Where do I find the printer IP address?
1. Click on 'Printer Info' in the top right corner
2. The printer IP address will be under 'Active IP (WLAN)'

What does a triangle with an exclamation mark on the screen of the power pack mean?
• This means overload and is caused when the power pack has the power on but the AC power button is turned off
• The AC draw is trying to occur and it overloads the power pack
To fix:
• Unplug the printer then turn the AC power on (also known as the AC inverter)
• Plug the printer back in after the AC power has been turned on (green light will be on)

The power pack shuts down after 4 - 5 hours
• Turn the power pack off then on to reset
