DC Rush Process

What is Rush?
A Rush Order is inventory that is sent out to stores when it isn't allocated to, or demanded by stores due to another business driver.

Why do we rush?
There are 5 key business drivers which necessitate Rush Orders.

1) Support DC racking utilisation/optimisation (keep the DC operating)
2) Reduce multiple SC touchpoints of inventory.
3) Support un-forecasted sales demand
4) Assist stores in filling bulk or high selling ends quickly.
5) Support sales of seasonal stock spikes

Typically, the kinds of items that are sent out as part of a rush order fall under one of the following categories:

Pallets of inventory that are not using full storage capacity in the DC racking such as:
• Oddments - Inventory in racking that is less than one case per store based on inventory-maintained store rush list
• Residual Inventory - Remaining Inventory post unpack without allocation/demand, less than Ti/Hi*

Inventory that would have a high sell-through rate such as:
• Seasonal Inventory - Inventory that is selling well due to the time of year (e.g., heaters in the Winter months)
• Store DC Rush Inventory - Inventory requested by stores that are normally used to fill bulk ends quickly (e.g., Microwaves)
• Major Events Inventory - Inventory which is associated with a major event at that point in time to support sales demand (e.g., Butane Gas canisters for Disaster Relief)

*Ti/Hi = The number of cartons stacked on a layer or tier (Ti), and the number of layers high the cartons are able to be stacked on the pallet (Hi) before reaching the maximum capacity of the pallet.

How can we control Rush Ordering better going forward?

Going forward DCs will:
• Follow the procedural controls specified above, including appropriate sign off on all types of Rush Orders.
• Communicate plans of sending bulk rush orders to stores before it gets loaded to ensure the store can hold the inventory. This will reduce the amount of inventory sent back to DCs due to congestion issues in BOH.

Going forward Stores could:
• Request high-selling bulk inventory more often so DCs could send inventory to the right stores at the right times, rather than sending the inventory to stores that don't have the capacity.
