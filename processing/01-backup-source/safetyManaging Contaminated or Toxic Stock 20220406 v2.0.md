Managing Contaminated or Toxic Stock

Contaminated or toxic stock sent to our stores is a rare instance, however if stock is identified as being contaminated or toxic it is important that extreme caution is taken to ensure the safety of our team and customers.

This guide outlines the process of identifying contaminated or toxic stock and the steps that need to be taken to isolate the stock and inform all the relevant areas of the business to support the DC or a store with accounting for the stock and disposing of it safely.

Please Note: Contaminated or toxic stock excludes mouldy stock and insect infestations (please note insect infestations are managed separately).

Identify & Report an Incident Process

Step | Action

Step 1 | Stock is identified as contaminated or toxic e.g., offensive, or distinct smell or visually apparent. The Team member is to alert a manager immediately.

Step 2 | Do not touch the stock and isolate, placing signs on it to ensure no other Team members touch the stock.

Info | Isolating stock signs to be created should read as:
WARNING - Contaminated products - DO NOT TOUCH
Create and print into A4, with enough copies to cover each side of the stock or container the stock is within.

Step 3 | Using PPE such as masks, gloves and goggles move the stock into a secure location:
• Place the isolating stock sign as above on all sides of the stock to ensure it is very clear that it should not be touched.
• Speak to your manager about where the stock should be stored and whether any additional controls are required (e.g., storing away from ignition sources if potentially flammable, storing near emergency response equipment, storing in a well-ventilated area etc.)

Step 4 | Raise the issue as a safety hazard via Solvsafety - Health & Safety Central (Click Here)

Step 5 | Call your Safety Manager and Loss Prevention Business Partner and advise them of the incident.
The Safety Manager/Head of Health & Safety is to contact the Head of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs to advise them of the incident.

Info | Your Safety Manager and Loss Prevention Manager will reach out to additional areas of the business to help support and resolve the issue which may include:
• Ensuing the team and customers are safe
• Storage considerations for the stock
• Testing the stock to identify the issue (this helps to prevent reoccurrences)
• Removing the stock
• Adjusting any stock off the system to ensure your Stock on hand is accurate
• Gathering all cost impacts to assist in insurance claims

Step 6 | Wait for instructions from your Loss Prevention Business Partner for the required stock adjustments to be completed.

Step 2 | Wait for confirmation from your Loss Prevention Business Partner to adjust the stock under code 27 (Fire/Water/Natural Disaster).

Step 3 | Identify the stock to be adjusted:
