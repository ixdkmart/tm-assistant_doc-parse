Contaminant in product guide

Objects in products

There may be instances where stores or customers identify foreign objects within and/or placed on products such as metal contaminates (i.e. blades, needles, clippers, etc.). Generally, the contaminants are identified in one of two ways, either in store (during decant or on the shop floor) by team members or customers or by a customer after they have purchased the item.

Note: This process excludes syringes (used/unused), dispose of syringe in store using the sharps container found in the sharps disposal kit.

Identified during Decant or On Selling floor

Where the product is identified during decant or while merchandised on the selling floor stores are to follow the below process:

Finding contaminant
› During Decant any foreign objects (e.g. blades, needles, clippers, etc) found by team members should be immediately passed onto the decant facilitator for immediate action:
• Decant facilitator should capture relevant product information (keycode, description, etc) and take photos of carton, product & contaminant.
• Decant facilitator should pass object and other information (including photos) onto a manager for reporting.

› On the selling floor, any foreign objects in products (e.g. blades, needles, clippers, etc) found by customers or team members should be immediate reported to a manager.
• Manager is to immediately attend to the incident and
    ▪ If GM product obtain foreign object and capture product details.
    ▪ If clothing item obtain item with needle (or foreign object) still in place.
    ▪ If syringe identified (used/unused) dispose of syringe in store using the sharps container found in the sharps disposal kit.
    Ensure appropriate safety equipment (i.e. safety gloves) worn when handling identified objects.
• Where it is a needle in an apparel item organise a check of product in the close vicinity (i.e. same rack) for any other needle contaminations.
    Note: Ensure team members wear appropriate safety equipment (i.e. safety gloves) when checking stock.
• If multiple items are found with needles during this check, indicating a possible targeted contamination, manager should immediately escalate incident to Compliance team and Zone Manager for further instructions on additional actions.

Important: Please be mindful of customer's perception of foreign objects in products, particularly needles in light of recent food incidents, and assure the customer that this will be immediately reported and the contaminant (object) and product (if apparel item) sent for further investigation.
