Push to Talk – Quick Tips

Charging your Radio
• Charge the battery – before you start your shift, ensure the battery has been charged (take those with green light where possible)
• Turn the P2T unit off prior to charging (otherwise may cause interference across P2T fleet)
• Insert the P2T unit face down (with battery installed) into the charging slot
• Charging time is approximately 2.5 hours in a multi-unit charger (from zero charge)
• Problems with charging may be due to dirty connections, gently rub the silver connection points with an eraser to clean

Care & Maintenance
• When the P2T unit is not in use, turn it off to extend battery longevity (consider charging over lunch breaks)
• Use alcohol wipes only to clean the earpiece
• Use a soft damp cloth to clean the exterior of the P2T unit.
• To avoid earpiece cord damage, Ensure the cord is run inside the uniform of the wearer to avoid snags
• Remove the earpiece when not in use hang earpiece on hooks (see below process to ensure this is set up in your store. IT Equipment (PDT & PTT) Management Team Responsibilities
• When removing or attaching the earpiece, twist the P2T unit and not the earpiece cable plug – This prevents damage to the cable
• Do Not wrap the earpiece around the P2T unit - This also prevents damage to the cable
• Do Not swing the P2T unit by the earpiece - This also prevents damage to the cable
• Press the main P2T unit button gently and in the center of the button to avoid damage

Push to Talk – Troubleshooting Guide

Individual P2T
• P2T not powering on – Place battery in charger. Flashing = Battery fault. Log INC and send back to RTB
• P2T not working- try to clone the unit again to confirm it has not lost its settings. If not Log INC and send back to RTB
• P2T unit keeps turning itself off – place unit in battery charger. If it flashes log INC and RTB
• Ear piece mic button not working – test earpiece with another device. If fine - no further action.
If the same problem occurs log INC and RTB
• P2T main button sticking/will not push in- Log INC and RTB.

When to order replacement P2T headsets
Please ensure you log faulty headsets to be sent back and replaced through the RTB portal.

Any additional equipment can be requested by emailing: kmrtrtb@kmart.com.au

RTB can only help based on your current store standard.

Multiple P2T
If you have multiple units with crackling issues, there are tests that can be done with all units at once. This should be done when all units are not in use and with time permitting.

The units work to a one to many principle and therefore if one unit is crackling it could make all of them sound crackly.

To identify the issue, recall all units to the office and turn off before performing one of the below tests.

• Test one: Loose connection with earpiece
1) Unscrew earpiece from unit
2) Re-screw earpiece into the unit for each device.

• Test two: Isolating faulty headset (Crackling)
1) Take two units and turn them both on
2) Test speaking one to other and back
3) Put any crackling ones aside and turn them off
4) Continue testing two working units at a time until you get two units that aren't crackling. Turn one off and keep one for the remainder of testing.
5) Using the known working unit, go through h the remaining unit until all P2T have been tested.
6) Faulty units to separated and log INC and RTB
