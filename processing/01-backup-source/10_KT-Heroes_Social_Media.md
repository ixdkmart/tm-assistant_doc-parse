<p><strong>Kmart Group Social Media Policy Training — Full Structured Transcript</strong></p><p><strong>1. Introduction: New Team Members Celebrate Their First Week</strong></p><p><strong>Characters:</strong> Cyril, Martha, and Leroy — new Kmart team members.<br /><strong>Setting:</strong> It’s <strong>NAIDOC Week</strong>. After completing their first shift, they want to share their excitement online.</p><p><strong>Dialogue:</strong></p><p><strong>Cyril:</strong> “It’s our first week in-store and I’m loving the NAIDOC celebrations. It’s deadly!”<br /><strong>Martha:</strong> “You know what we should do? We should take a picture of the three of us in our Kmart uniforms, here in front of the store, and post it on LinkedIn to celebrate our first week. I’ve seen other posts from team members doing the same.”<br /><strong>Leroy:</strong> “Great idea. Let’s mention something like, <em>‘We’re proud to work here. NAIDOC Week at Kmart — what a fantastic day the three of us had!’</em> A very proud moment.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>“This is a good news story. We like seeing our team members share their excitement on social media.”</p><p><strong>2. Social Media — What Counts?</strong></p><p>“The types of social media platforms include forums, social networks, public sharing sites, microblogs, and blogs.”</p><p><strong>Examples given:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Forums:</strong> Whirlpool, Yahoo Groups — <em>places where users connect and share content.</em></li><li><strong>Social networks:</strong> Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Snapchat, Slack, Yammer.</li><li><strong>Public sharing sites:</strong> Wikipedia, YouTube, Instagram, Flickr.</li><li><strong>Microblogs:</strong> Twitter, Tumblr.</li><li><strong>Blogs:</strong> WordPress, corporate and personal blogs — <em>anywhere individuals share opinions or journals.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Key Message:</strong></p><p>“When used constructively and appropriately, social media can be beneficial for Kmart Group, our team members, and our business partners.”</p><p><strong>3. Case Study: Drew’s TikTok Video</strong></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />Drew promotes new casual sportswear by wearing a sport cap, imitating a well-known rapper, and playing a song with violent, explicit lyrics. He records a video in front of the display and uploads it to TikTok.</p><p><strong>Dialogue:</strong></p><p><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> “Haha, that’s funny… Wait—have you seen that it’s starting to go viral? I think your friend shared it further.”<br /><strong>Narration:</strong> “Posts made in a private social media forum can be copied and shared in other public social media forums and can quickly go viral.”<br /><strong>Drew:</strong> “Oh, it’s harmless fun. I’m sure our customers can relate — we’ll make good sales.”<br /><strong>Gabrielle:</strong> “I don’t think so. It looks like it’s jumped over to LinkedIn and Facebook too. I’ve been tagged to have a look at it on three different sites.”<br /><strong>Manager:</strong> “Drew, can you please come to the store manager’s office?”</p><p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p><p>“Always consider what’s appropriate before posting on social media, personally or professionally. Ask yourself: <em>‘Does this represent Kmart?’</em>”</p><p><strong>4. Key Reflection Questions Before You Post</strong></p><p>“Click each question to reveal more information…”</p><ul><li>Could my post harm or lower the reputation of <strong>Kmart Group</strong>, or any of its team members, customers, or partners?</li><li>Is my post <strong>lawful</strong>?</li><li>Would I be comfortable if my <strong>manager or family saw it</strong>, or if it was in the <strong>news</strong>?</li><li>How would this post reflect on <strong>me personally</strong>?</li></ul><p><strong>Policy Reminder:</strong></p><p>“If your conduct breaches other Kmart Group policies — such as the Code of Conduct or Workplace Behaviour Policy — you may be subject to disciplinary action.”<br />“Conduct that involves discrimination, harassment, or defamation may also breach the law.”<br />“You must ensure that posts do not include personal information about others or anything that could damage the reputation or business interests of Kmart Group.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>“You might think your privacy settings mean you’re protected, but anything you share can be shared by others.”</p><p><strong>5. Drew’s Consequences</strong></p><p>“The video connects our product to a song about violence and swearing — that’s not in line with what we stand for at Kmart Group and could damage the reputation of our business.”<br />“Recording something like this during work hours, mentioning Target in your post, and the store you were at, can cause a serious breach of the social media policy.”<br />“If you’re found to have breached the policy, you may be disciplined. This could range from counselling to formal warnings — and if really serious, termination of employment.”</p><p><strong>What Drew should do next time:</strong></p><ol><li><em>“Purchase the product, take it home, record it in his own time, and ensure none of his actions are connected to Kmart Group.”</em></li><li><em>“Ask for his manager’s permission before recording.”</em></li><li><em>“Share ideas with marketing or merchandise teams instead of posting on his own.”</em></li></ol><p><strong>6. Case Study: Leroy Replies to a Customer Online</strong></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />Leroy, on his break, scrolls through #KmartOz and sees a frustrated customer post:</p><p>“My online order always gets split up. It’s so frustrating. So sick of this hashtag Kmart Oz. Can’t you fix it so I can get my outfit all in one go?”</p><p>Leroy decides to reply:</p><p>“I hear you, Kmart customer. I’ve just started working here and the processes are a bit of a shambles when it comes to our online orders. We really should be doing better about getting your order all at once.”</p><p>The next day, a news headline reads:</p><p><em>“Kmart Online Process Shambles.”</em><br />His quote is featured in the article.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong></p><p>“As a Kmart Group team member, responding to a customer on social media gives the media the right to quote you as a Kmart Group representative.”</p><p><strong>Lesson:</strong></p><p>“Only the dedicated social media communications team should respond to customer comments. To avoid confusion, team members should not engage directly.”</p><p><strong>Correct Advice from Mel (Manager):</strong></p><p>“If you see any concerning comments on social media, send a private message to Kmart Group regarding the page, or contact our Corporate Communications team who can respond directly.”</p><p><strong>7. Case Study: Linda and Rishi’s Office Video</strong></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />Linda and Rishi film a playful video in their office pod while wearing Kmart lanyards, with visible Kmart and Target signage. They upload it to YouTube titled <em>“Getting Paid to Muck Around.”</em></p><p><strong>Consequences:</strong></p><p>“If this video is found to have breached policy, they may be disciplined — ranging from counselling to termination.”<br />“This could also result in damage to Kmart Group’s corporate reputation.”</p><p><strong>8.

Always know what’s appropriate when using social media, both personally and professionally.”</p><p><strong>9. Case Study: Jack’s Product Recall Post</strong></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />Jack, a buyer, discovers that a product might be faulty and posts on Facebook warning customers not to buy it.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“This is not okay — even though Jack has good intentions.”<br />“This type of message should only come from an authorised spokesperson or the recall team.”</p><p><strong>10. Case Study: Maria’s AFL Argument</strong></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />Maria, whose Facebook profile lists her as a Kmart Group employee, posts on a TV show’s page debating about whether the AFL Grand Final should be at night. She uses inappropriate language.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“This is not okay. While Maria is entitled to personal views, because her profile identifies her as a Kmart team member, her comments could damage the company’s reputation.”</p><p><strong>Reminder:</strong></p><p>“Posts made in private forums can be copied and shared publicly, which is why it’s important to know what’s appropriate at all times.”</p><p><strong>11. Case Study: Vera’s Holiday Photos</strong></p><p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br />Vera posts pictures from her holiday.
