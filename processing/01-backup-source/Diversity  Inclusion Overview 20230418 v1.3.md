Diversity

Kmart's people plan and better together strategy aims to ensure that our business is a great place to shop, is right for everyone and enables us to attract the best talent to sustain the growth of our business.

We will know Kmart is right for everyone when our stores, DC's and offices reflect the communities in which we operate in. This extends to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, people with disability and women in leadership roles. Stay tuned to understand more about the FY17 plan.
