# What should I know about health and safety at Kmart?

Answer:
Safety is everyone's responsibility, every hour and day. Be trained for your tasks. Report hazards immediately. Tell your manager about any incidents or injuries right away.

Tip: Always stay alert and speak up if something feels unsafe.

Why/When: Keeping everyone safe helps us all work better and feel secure.
